1416669285 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, man, this confuses me. I say frick-a-fracken when I mean the f word. Should that be disallowed?
1416669152 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, It's all in intent though, I can say to someone one 'Fack you' , and I'm still saying f*ck, or at least intending that 
1416669086 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, 
Yeah, but WTF is allowed. He didn't cuss someone out and didn't use the real word.
1416668558 Hotline_101: It means 'b*tches', so...
