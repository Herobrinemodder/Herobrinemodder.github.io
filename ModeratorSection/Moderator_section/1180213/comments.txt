1405176620 TheCanadianFluffy: MLT did say he is on the list to become a moderator and he is still working hard to get there.
1404827365 TheCanadianFluffy: sfdude... The next girl moderator...
1404812452 Bob Ross: @Frios10, yeah
1404707863 Frios10: Anyone else having this problem?
1404707767 Frios10: The reports aren't loading. Just trying to clean them now...
1404707705 Frios10: @Hotline_101, do you remember how she moderates? Fight with the user the call in us to clean it up.
1404707665 Frios10: @Hotline_101, no way
1404701451 Hotline_101: Should re-appointing Bolt be considered? She has become active lately 
1404629096 Frios10: And maybe wolfdata0514
1404603709 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, most at once 30
1404603699 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, I am dealing with a few..2-4 a day
1404599501 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, why are you going to remain a moderator then.... Specifically if you ARENT dealing with reports at all :P
1404593422 Bob Ross: Andrew can just take reports.
1404593405 Bob Ross: Telepathic, sfdude are very organized and disciplined and are nice to work with.
1404593355 Bob Ross: Andrew!
1404586461 Frios10: sfdude and 
Telepathic grunt for sure!

1404575144 Hotline_101: Telepathic and SFDude are really the two best candidates
1404571443 Hellomynameis99: That's Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt™
1404571382 TheCanadianFluffy: Sorry for that massive comment :~P
1404571329 TheCanadianFluffy: MLT is defiantly someone I would want to work beside. He deals with problems properly and I believe he has a clean record with violating rules. Like Hotline said he might not still be up to it he has been on the app for a while.

?TurtleMan? Nice and active. I would trust him with many things.

Telepathic Grunt, active,reports often and does make real reports. Great candidate!

Those are just mine I wanted to bring up. I still think sfdude is a good candidate.
1404571151 Hellomynameis99: sfdude and Telepathic Grunt are both good candidates
1404570983 Hotline_101: Awesome! 

SFDude
MLT (If he's up to it)
And maybe Slenderwolf? 

(Fluffy could say more about him then I know)
