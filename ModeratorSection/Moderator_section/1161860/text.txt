Hey guys!
I've heard a few users complain about long upload times. After a few tests I found a possible way to halve the upload times.
Take a look at the image.
Basically:
If "image" = uploading {
Begin processing next image
}
This way, images can process ready for uploading while the previous images are uploading.
Questions? Comments? Concerns?
