1386040038 Hotline_101: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, He isn't, more then likely, it's someone who knows...
1386039673 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: umm... Idk cuz im talking to the real mexicankidd. He is trying really hard to become nice and i respect that. but this user i have no clue about
1386037103 kathryncrusher: @Hotline_101, Indeed.
1386036156 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, That seems like a mighty coincidence 
1386030154 kathryncrusher: @#Herobrine#, ... That was something :P
1386030138 kathryncrusher: Hmm... Either he is tricking us or mocking, like Frios said or he is actually being good knowing nothing about MexicanKidd and what he did.
1385998775 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Yah, I'm just wondering what his full "priorities" are
1385996401 Frios10: He's probably mocking us or looking for a good laugh
1385975853 Bob Ross: Gives the children sweets and biscuits at first...

THEN HE EATS THE LITTLE SUCKERS ALIVE
1385969216 Hellomynameis99: Looks like he/she's trying to be good... A poor choice of username, I must say...
