1400862816 Surikaten.: @falkirknh, it's the general rule, you are responsible for what you post unless you post copyrighted or other illegal content and the rightful owner files a complaint about it, then the post has to be taken down regardless. Is there any particular issue that needs to be looked in to?
1400828595 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, where do I find any contracts or customer guarantees...I don't know if any poster has content rights...maybe they mentioned it but I didn't see...do you remember any "Agree to these conditions" when you started...?
1400811186 falkirknh: General question: How are posts currently licensed? Does the poster retain all rights to the content?
1400731519 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, I'm not a troll
1400721805 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, and you :P
1400714291 Frios10: @Pykirknh, hey I'm against this
1400712283 TheCanadianFluffy: I did think of this when I saw this and many other uploads that are similar and I didn't bring it up because I agree it would give us too much power. It would be much simpler to edit but if the user is willing to change it them self they can, if they don't we just delete the upload.
1400708256 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, well, we wouldn't have a moderator that trolls in the first place...except Frios :P
1400635071 Hotline_101: This seems too... Powerful... What if we add a moderator who trolls? They could put a description in a post to get someone banned
1400626145 Hellomynameis99: Hmm, yep. Users may feel that they don't have the freedom of speech that they used to, even if this is not the case (I'd trust you not to remove constructive content)
1400619058 Frios10: @falkirknh, users will feel like they can't say what they want. Plus we will get reports saying " please edit there description I don't like what it says" and when we say no the user will get offended and if we do so the uploader will feel like unessacary limits are being Put on him or her.
1400615404 Surikaten.: Just my two cents and how I like to see social networks and other community websites operate. Sorry for all the edits, tried to keep it as short as possible :-p
1400615133 Surikaten.: While I understand why this is useful for various communities it gets increasingly problematic the more nuansed the audience. It's much better to then let users be fully responsible for what was posted, and if there is something that needs editing the user is given the choice to either edit their upload or face the concequences of that particular rule violation.
1400614388 Surikaten.: @falkirknh, heh that's not the case at all, you guys are given special features that aren't offered for everyone and these even include removing content - if fear of malevolence were the case these privilieges wouldn't be given at all. That aside, it's the basic principle that some users can edit your uploads regardless of whether you want to or not, it gives too much authority to individual users
1400613602 falkirknh: @Surikaten., I understand your hesitation, but I work on many communities and this has never presented an issue. If you are consistently trying to find ways to inhibit our supposed malevolence, we become more of an hindrance than a help :-)
1400613368 falkirknh: I disagree with your suggested usage, if users place profanity in an upload then removing it will just start an edit war and lead to us removing it anyway. Editing could be used to fix general post syntax and other issues. Edits could be logged in a table for security purposes. From experience, editing is great for general purpose fixes, if something violates a rule directly it is best to delete.
1400597915 Surikaten.: ...an excessive and inbalanced ability in any respect

But I can see the positives. Warning the user however puts the responsibility back on the user again, if they don't willingly edit their upload to comply with the rules it means they stand by the rule violation and you'll be able to take more robust action from there, without them being able to blame it on someone else, if that makes sense :-)
1400597807 Surikaten.: I can see the positive aspects in this feature but would also have to agree with Frios, aside from that also agree with the con you listed as well, because if moderators can edit other users uploads it would make mods free from all the responsibility of that description, ie mods would have the ability and power to 'put words in other users mouths' and whatnot, which feels like...
1400592767 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, of course :-)
1400592258 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Thanks for your input. :-) I do think that post editing would give moderators too much authority, but I still think that this issue needs to be addressed somewhat. Thanks again! :-P
1400590364 Frios10: ..uploads
1400590352 Frios10: I think that's a little to much power for us...kind of like the see who rated you thing a guy asked for so he could go fight with the one star rater. It's a feature that would cause to much I think. Simply warning the user to edit after the user edits delete the conversation and move it to its section and be done. It's not as simple but still gives users the power to have what they want in there..
