1407145295 Bob Ross: Wow,I never realized I was that worked out.
1407145201 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yep, same here. Resisted moderating warnings...
1407085476 TheCanadianFluffy: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, She has said a few things about me to other people and Im sick of it.
1407075993 Hotline_101: Ah, I hate her sometimes, mostly because she picked a fight about a warning I sent 
1407048564 Frios10: I saw a lot of comments like that directed towards you. One being on my own post...wait that might have been hotline...I forgot
1407045889 DimplesCS: Wow seeing as she has been warned on the past month i do think a temp-ban would serve best
