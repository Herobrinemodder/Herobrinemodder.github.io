<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Should we end these posts?</h2><p>Hello moderator peers,
You may have seen many of these "bring back the past" posts lately. They preach that the app is "falling apart" and that the off topic section gets more rates then seeds. Well I've never seen more then 5 rates on an off topic upload most of the time. Most seeds have 10+ rates. These people are overreacting. Here are some examples
seeds://sAO5gTM0ETM_
seeds://sQO1UTM0ETM_
seeds://sgMzgTM0ETM_
seeds://sQO2AjM0ETM_
seeds://sgM4AjM0ETM_
Please leave input JN and moderators!
