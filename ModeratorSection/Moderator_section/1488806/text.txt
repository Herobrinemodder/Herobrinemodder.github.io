Protecting myself.
I think it was Hotline and I discussing Tactical's ban status.  I said I'd send Tactical a PM to see if he'd respond.  So I sent him one asking if he was an Atheist.
Not even a few minutes later I get a PM from SuperDucky saying they didn't want to talk religion.  So I thought they were Tactical PMing me with a different account.  But it wasn't Tactical.  It really was a different user.
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THAT HAPPENING ???
Anyway, I tried to be nice by doing small talk with them to kind of cover my tracks.
The next day, SuperDucky made some comments on this post:

And I was responding to them.  Cro decided to jump in so I sent SuperDucky a message to let them know they can ignore Cro if he starts getting bad.  I was worried over how carried away he would get.
Anyway, the PM went downhill from there.  Her mom got involved.
So, I'm uploading the whole PM because I'm sure J.n is going to get involved due to SuperDucky's mom.
And I see nothing wrong with what I was saying.
