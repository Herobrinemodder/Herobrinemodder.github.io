<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>This is out of hand</h2><p>Hey, apparently this user has been diagnosed with cancer and also died. However, a user has found a selfie of what was supposedly iCrystal but was found on the Internet. This is proof that iCrystal is not that person. On the other hand, this doesn't mean the cancer and death is fake. But, as you can see on pic 1, the bio. It is spelt incorrectly, and doesn't look like something that would be used for a death. The bio would be corrected and made to the best, larger than the bio that is shown and more detailed . Also, surely her friend wouldn't do the bio, but let the mother or father of the user do it instead as they have the right to decide whether they want their daughters death posted on a minecraft app. If this is false, I strongly believe that the user is banned at the highest rank, like a device ban. Faking a death and posting it on a minecraft forum app to get attention is over the line.
