1402673914 TheCanadianFluffy: @Minecraft Seeds, You speak :~P
1402671037 Minecraft Seeds: He was indeed warned in the past as well as banned. High time for a device ban this time. :-)
1402409069 TheCanadianFluffy: It looks like its time to ban him. If he was warned before and is cussing again, he clearly doesn't care what happens. I vote ban.
1402405316 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Yep, looks like he's back to continue 
1402387374 Hellomynameis99: 8 months ago, K9mav was issued with a stern warning for excessive use of profane language. I don't think he was banned though....
