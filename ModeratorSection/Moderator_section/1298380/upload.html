<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Memes</h2><p>Someone complained about the curse word used in this meme (made kid-friendly by myself for this upload).  Should the uploader be told to remove it or should they be told they need to post a warning in their description or just ignore it?
Also, who is able to view these mod posts in this "Moderators upload" area?
