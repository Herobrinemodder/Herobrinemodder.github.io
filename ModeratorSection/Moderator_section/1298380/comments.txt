1412068366 bubblybabs: I had replied earlier but it must have had a bad word in it because it's gone now. How do I find out what words are allowed? How about these words: b* t ch, h*ll, d*mn

1412060895 Bob Ross: @notsfdude, yes earlier in the year s h i t was allowed through the profanity filter.
1412060084 Hellomynameis99: @notsfdude, Sh!t is profanity now, but earlier in the year is was declassified as profane due to people using it loosely. This can generally still apply as long as the word isn't used against someone or with I'll intent, such as this meme.
1412050489 notsfdude: @Hellomynameis99_, wait, wait, wait. I thought 'sh**' was profanity no matter what! Did this rule change?
1412030466 Hellomynameis99: That meme is perfectly fine. You might know that "sh!t" was not classified as profane for quite a while. As long as it's not directed at someone or isn't used in a hateful manner, there's no problem with small things like this. Users who report it can be referred to the block and ignore features to self-moderate the content they see.

As for your second question, only moderators and developers can view posts here. :-)
