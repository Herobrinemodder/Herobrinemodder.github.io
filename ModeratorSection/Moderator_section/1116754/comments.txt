1400635674 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hotline_101, Surikaten had a chat with him and he seemed to clam down. We are friends at the moment.
1400635520 Hotline_101: AB has just become more and more erratic since the incident with me, probably my fault...
1400425697 TheCanadianFluffy: @Surikaten., Okay sure I will
1400425641 Surikaten.: @TheCanadianFluffy, if he continues please make another thread as it might be hightime for another bann of his, he tried 'getting Hotline demoted' not too long ago as well, feels like giving him multiple chances he'll just use those to continue try frame others
1400425555 TheCanadianFluffy: @Surikaten., What are we going to do about him?
1400425541 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, Ive got multiple reports about him.
1400425468 Surikaten.: He used to be banned once in the past but was unbanned after multiple emails and actively waiting 3 months for the bann to be lifted
1400425054 Hellomynameis99: AB has been sporting to me recently... I haven't seen any of this.
