1375916400 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, he must be restrained. He can scare JN's clients.
1375743600 Hotline_101: @Frios10, ok
1375743600 Hotline_101: @falkirknh, He kept spitting out Bible verses at me when I told him to stop posting religious threads, and he didn't listen to the part of the bible stating, Though shalt obey the authorities God hath set over you
1375743600 Frios10: @falkirknh, how do you log in to it?
1375743600 Frios10: @Hotline_101, we took care of it ;)
1375743600 Hotline_101: @falkirknh, The dude is acting like some kinda extremist Christian who makes all the Christians look bad
1375743600 Frios10: @falkirknh, I am going to check it out now
1375743600 falkirknh: @Frios10, oh the ticket system. It's working great only I can't get users to adopt it as a reporting feature. 
1375743600 Frios10: @falkirknh, yea what was the new mod feature you were working on? Can you post it on the mod board?
1375743600 falkirknh: @Frios10, sorry about the arguing, was pretty unprofessional. I keep trying to make peace with him, anyway should be done now :)
1375743600 Frios10: Have you reported any of his threads?
1375743600 Frios10: Also he said he is leaving the app to find him self on a private thread. He also said he will come back. I don't think he is a problem
1375743600 Frios10: Hmm I've seen him. I think we should tell him if he wants to have religious threads to make them private and not tell others there going to ____ 
1375743600 Hellomynameis99: I agree... Ninety percent of the comments on his threads are "This is a minecraft app, not a God app", and the other ten percent are "Amen"
