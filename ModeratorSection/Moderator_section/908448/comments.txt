1388455272 Frios10: "Leader of all bad guys" that's funny
1388448461 TheCanadianFluffy: @Surikaten., Good, thanks :D
1388293563 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, make that steaming, fresh evidence.
1388292911 Surikaten.: As he wish, perma device bann for him. :-)
1388285173 Hotline_101: He's trying to get a ban, Permaban for him
1388281526 Hellomynameis99: Ban. Even if he's not The Bloo Taboo, impersonating a banned user should result in a ban.

I mean, come on. Saying you are a banned user is handing us the evidence on a gilded platter.
1388267929 Bob Ross: IP BAN HAMMER
1388267915 Bob Ross: You let him make you mad...

(shakes his head)

But yeah, he's still a motherf***er by the looks of if.
