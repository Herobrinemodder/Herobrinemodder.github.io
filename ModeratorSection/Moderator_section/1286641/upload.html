<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>The "MLT" incident </h2><p>Mkay so before i set out the books i want to assure any of you that I'm fine with you telling MLT every single character on this upload so he can spam me about it so yeah let ago!
It started off as me telling him to put *multiple comments* in his report desc so he doesn't make 20 reports all on the same thread, makes sense right? Then it somehow escalated into a history lesson about moderating because he has a "PhD" in this stuff, and then explaining to me about how long it takes to do his reports and i honestly didn't think you could solve a report so fast~ took that one from hello:P
And further more escalated to where he had all my information like email and steam passwords (sarcasm) and now has efficiently spammed me for 30ish minutes while i put on a comedy show for fluffy(again sarcasm) 
Thank you for this rant opportunity
I do however apologize if it seems like I'm to harsh, rude, or i should let MLT moderate for me.
