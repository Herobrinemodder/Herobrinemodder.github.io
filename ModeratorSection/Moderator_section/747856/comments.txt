1378940400 Hellomynameis99: @Minecraft Seeds, Thanks, Good Sir! :-)
1378940400 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, ok thanks 
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hellomynameis99_, Sorry for the delay on the fix! It should work properly now. And we took the time to delete MEXICANCHILD's offensive comments so no need to re-remove them. :-)
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @Frios10, He was uploading an excessive amount of lets say 'inappropriate' stuff to the app, which we took down as well as writing inappropriate comments to other users. Was reported by two unrelated people. :-)
1378854000 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yah, some of the users may be truly sorry for wat they did, but others don't deserve the chance to wreck more havoc 
1378854000 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yep, same 
1378854000 Frios10: @Hotline_101, I gtg ttyl
1378854000 Frios10: @Hotline_101, me neither I am waiting for a response though...if I think it's not worth being banned I am requesting that he is unbanned.
1378854000 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I can't see any other reason JN would ban him 
1378854000 Hotline_101: @Frios10, That's what I would suspect 
1378854000 Frios10: @Hotline_101, oh so your saying the atheist got him banned?
1378854000 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Thats what Im saying, he was going up against Red Armor, who was attacking Christian threads and claimed to be an Atheist 
1378854000 Frios10: @Hotline_101, no he's not an atheist. He had some Christian threads. 
1378854000 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Hmmm, maybe it was those annoying Atheist wannabes....
1378854000 Frios10: @Hotline_101, yea but I was looking at his profile he looks innocent but I could be wrong
1378854000 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Im pretty sure he did something to deserve banning 
1378854000 Hellomynameis99: When I say lag I mean the 1-2 minutes you may have to wait for an action to become visible, such as reporting a thread.
1378854000 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., New bug! :-)

I can't delete comments anymore. I've tried to remove MEXICANCHILD 6 9's comment on one of my threads twice, but it's still there... The first time I tried to delete it was about an hour ago, so it can't have been latency/lag
1378854000 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, it is yes, they can only see it though but not use it, warning comments shouldn't popup
1378854000 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, that should be fixed... Surikaten & I dealt with it a few hours ago...
1378854000 Bob Ross: @Minecraft Seeds, normal users can use the warning feature!!!! I saw my friend use it and many people are abusing it...is that a bug???
1378854000 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, do you mind explaining why red wolf was banned? I would just like to know
1378767600 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Looks helpful :)
1378767600 Hellomynameis99: @Minecraft Seeds, Cool, you reply notified me :-)
1378767600 Minecraft Seeds: @Hellomynameis99_, no they're mod exclusive :-) <testing edit feature real quick>
1378767600 Hellomynameis99: Are these banned tags visible to all users?
