<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Two new mod tweaks</h2><p>Hey guys!
Just wanted to announce two quick new perks and tweaks for mods in the new 4.0.1 update.
The first one is that you can now see if a user is banned or not directly in their profile - so it's now much easier to know whether a user has been taken care of already or not. A banned user will have a red badge next to their name in their profile page as shown in the image.
The second one is that you can now warn users as well as uploaders - by simply tapping the report comment button next to a specific comment you'll be now given two choices: Report/Warn
Use with tenderness.. :-)
Also if you notice any bugs at all, don't hesitate to post a thread/comment here or let us know by email and we'll look into it asap.
Best!</p><img src=Two_new_mod_tweaks1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
