The original upload was posted on PlanetMinecraft in late 2012.
There is a world download, which would allow our copier (SantosoG3_92) to add signs to 'prove' that he built it. Just keep an eye out for that! :-)</p><img src=SantosoG3_92_and_the_Futuristic_City_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=SantosoG3_92_and_the_Futuristic_City_2.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=SantosoG3_92_and_the_Futuristic_City_3.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
