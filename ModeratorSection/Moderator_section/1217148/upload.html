The original upload was posted on PlanetMinecraft in late 2012.
There is a world download, which would allow our copier (SantosoG3_92) to add signs to 'prove' that he built it. Just keep an eye out for that! :-)</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-27/SantosoG3_92_and_the_Futuristic_City_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-27/SantosoG3_92_and_the_Futuristic_City_2.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-27/SantosoG3_92_and_the_Futuristic_City_3.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
