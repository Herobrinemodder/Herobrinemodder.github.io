With a bit of google magic, we can track down the original 'Minecraft Futuristic City'.
The original upload was posted on PlanetMinecraft in late 2012.
There is a world download, which would allow our copier (SantosoG3_92) to add signs to 'prove' that he built it. Just keep an eye out for that! :-)
