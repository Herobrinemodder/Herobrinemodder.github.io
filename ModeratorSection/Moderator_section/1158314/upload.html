This points idea seems pretty good. Perhaps it could be implemented alongside the report ticketing centre? It could be useful to determine who is a repeat offender.
Points can be added or subtracted for many actions. For example,
Upload approved +5 points
Upload removed (by uploader) -5 points
Upload removed (by moderator) -10 points
Warning received -5 points
Comment downvoted -1 points
Comment upvoted +1 points
Comment removed (by moderator) -2 points
Upload moved -2 points
We would probably have to adjust these numbers.
Any input?</p><img src=User_Suggestion1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
