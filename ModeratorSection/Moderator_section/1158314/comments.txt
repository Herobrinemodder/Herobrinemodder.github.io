1403596889 Hellomynameis99: @Pykirknh, Given up on?
1403586258 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, you're given up O_O
1403304066 TheCanadianFluffy: @Pykirknh, You stole my ninja mode thing :/
1403288729 Bob Ross: @Frios10, newer skins...?

Digital Trading cards...master card is Minecraft Seeds?
1403276421 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, hmm like what? 
1403256839 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Hmm, good point. That does mean that a points system like this would be useless for moderation.

However, this still could be an incentive to follow the rules. Users can use these 'SeedsPoints' to purchase random in-app rewards.
1403256551 Bob Ross: @Frios10, exactly
1403239320 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, like not having an upload makes you an offender?
1403239288 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, but what would the purpose be?
1403225707 Bob Ross: *ninja mode deadtivated*

Sounds a little unfair to new users.
1403220043 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, The thing is, you get 5 points for an approved upload, and 5 points are subtracted if you remove it. If a user does decide to remove all their uploads, they're no better off than when they started.
1403191762 Frios10: I don't think it's really nessecary 
1403191652 Frios10: Ehh what if they just want to restart and remove all there uploads just because? 
1403187394 Minecraft Seeds: ..we think this works best for all as it gives no special privilege to certain users and just draws a clear line of what is and what isn’t allowed so some users don’t try to bypass that or cheat the systems etc :-)
1403187261 Minecraft Seeds: …however a section that lists all the users who have received official warnings and bans for moderators is coming and will be available in the next coming update. So that should make things a bit easier and the general three-strike-policy will be a bit easier to apply, ie if a user violates the rules one time they receive a warning, second time a ban, if they return and proceed to violate the rules again either another ban or device ban depended on the severity..
1403187085 Minecraft Seeds: Hmm yeah this sounds like an idea, although it could potentially be a bit unreliable and unfair since it would be hard to determine who should be banned when based on their points. Users who have uploaded several uploads and racked up points that way would have a few more chances of violating the rules compared to new users, and if they violate the rules 4-5 times their points could still be very high and it wouldn’t be possible to determine if it's time for a bann or not...
1403184499 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Cool, so you think it's a good idea?
1403183356 Hotline_101: Yeah, sent a message to Surikaten. and the MCSeeds account yesterday about this, haven't responded yet :/
1403183193 Hellomynameis99: Perhaps points could be subtracted when an upload is moved. Hopefully this will make users will upload their off-topic content in the correct section! :-)
