<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>New mod tool 'Move'</h2><p>Hey guys,

As you've probably already noticed, the new update has finally been released for pro users. :-)Â Included in it we added the new 'Move thread' tool for mods. With this tool it is now possible to move uploads from one section to another quickly and swiftly without having to report it first. So if you spot an upload that was uploaded to a section it doesn't seem to fit in, you can now easily move it to a more appropriate section without any headache. :-) The effects of the change can take up to 1-2 minutes to appear but it should afterwards be moved automatically to the new section.

If you guys have any ideas of other features/improvements that could make moderating much easier and convenient don't hesitate to let us know and we'll look into it asap. :-)

Also sidenote, the top 25 page experienced a minor accident and was accidentally removed from the app along with the update, but it will be added back asap for the next coming update. Sorry about that :-)

Best!</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2013/09-02/New_mod_feature1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
