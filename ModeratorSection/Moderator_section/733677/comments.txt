1379199600 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Belly326, yeah, that's what I thought, it's and easier way to find TMB and everyone else xD
1378249200 Frios10: @AndrewDill, ok
1378249200 AndrewDill: @Frios10,Sorry,I was planning on doing it last weekend but had Internet issues so ill porbably start this weekend I hope.
1378249200 Xxxxxddddd: @AndrewDill, I uploaded a thread about it and people mostly said they used it to find people and it's fun having a goal..
1378249200 Frios10: @AndrewDill, so when were you going to start taking reports?
1378249200 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, alright everyone alright stop telling me that the Top 25 is bad. I get it -_-
1378162800 AndrewDill: @Hotline_101,Yea I find the follower competition stuff annoying as well.Is it really even nessisary to have a list of the top 25 most followed users anyway?
1378162800 Xxxxxddddd: @Hotline_101, agreed
1378162800 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, I think it's a good thing, it's created too much competition and stupidity about followers, if people are gonna be douches, let them leave 
1378162800 Bob Ross: @Minecraft Seeds, okay cool :-)

Also, people are getting kind of p****d off that there is no Top 25. They are calling this new update 'dumb' and insulting the head developer and developers of the app (insulting Nahir and the other cool Objective-C people)

I made a post about why it was cut out at the last second and it's not doing much...

Just a heads up.
1378076400 Minecraft Seeds: @#Herobrine#, ah, the black box of doom bug again. Apple isn't listening to us when it comes to that glitch. We'll try find a workaround for it manually in the next coming update and try fix it that way. Sorry for that :-)
1378076400 Xxxxxddddd: I love this feature I had to move a couple threads out of the role play section it makes the app a whole lot easier
1378076400 Xxxxxddddd: @#Herobrine#, I never see a black box because I have the iPad mini ;)
1378076400 Bob Ross: @Minecraft Seeds, oh and just in case you didn't notice your nyheter is kind of messed up.

Whenever you make a nyheter post about a new update for seeds pro, you put quite too much in it and all that we see is a black box.
1378076400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hellomynameis99_, we'll definitely be looking into that for the next coming update which will include a few more mod tools as well :)
1378076400 Minecraft Seeds: @#Herobrine#, sure :-)
1378076400 Hellomynameis99: I've already used this too... I've moved roleplays to the Roleplay section. It works really well, and I've found that it moves the upload instantly, there's no 1-2 minute waiting time. Good job! :-)

As a suggestion -
Can we have an in-app ticketing system? I'd like to make my report thread redundant, and it will be easier with ALL mods having access to the same reports in one location. :-)
1378076400 Bob Ross: May I tell users this new tool so they will know that I will be on more often and be more productive?
1378076400 Frios10: I've already used this :) I love it!
1378076400 toughguy42: I moved A few religious threads... They're getting out of hand.
