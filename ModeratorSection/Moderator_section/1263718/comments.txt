1409403935 Surikaten.: Hmm interesting idea! Will flag this as a feature to be looked in to for an upcoming update :-) If not the next coming one then hopefully for the one that follows.
1409061250 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Thanks! Could be added with a upcoming update unless something similar is already in development 
1409061189 Hellomynameis99: @TelepathicGrunt☆*ﾟ, It's pretty easy to self teach yourself! I don't do much with photos but I can still do something small like this. You might have to read a few tips, but if you use Paint.NET I can tell you the basics ;-P
1409061129 Hotline_101: Nice, looks like this would be pretty useful :)
1409060967 Hellomynameis99: @TelepathicGrunt☆*ﾟ, Nah, too clunky. And it takes too long to load.

I use Paint.NET
