Hey guys!
Enlarge the images for a better idea of the interface.
A report archive system was discussed today, and here's what I whipped up. Annotations are in red.
So - Moderators are able to view reports previously issued by each user and against each user, to help in decisions such as who to warn, ban or block from issuing reports.
In a user's profile, tap the report icon and select what type of reports you'd like to view: reports created by the user or reports created by other users against this user.
From there you can see what's been reported. Of course, you can't tap the report if it's already been marked as resolved.
In relation to the second (Reports against this user) section, only reports that have been marked as resolved by a moderator appear here. This means that false or spam reports that have been deleted by a moderator do not ruin a user's record.
