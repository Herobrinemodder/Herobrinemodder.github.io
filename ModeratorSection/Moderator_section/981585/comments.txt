1392482867 Mad Man T1zer 53: @MCRBGAMING, sorry for asking your age, but I love being the young one XD
1392142407 Bob Ross: @MCRBGAMING, I do not get it...
1392105263 Mcrbgaming: HueHueHue! I need more uploads (off topic of moderation) 
1392098589 Mcrbgaming: @falkirknh, thanks, I haven't talked to you in a while! :-)
1392097016 falkirknh: Sorry for the late response, but welcome to the team, it's great to have more help :-)
1391874190 TheCanadianFluffy: Welcome to the team! Great to have you :~)
1391861837 Mad Man T1zer 53: @MCRBGAMING, congrats dude!How old are you?
1391860327 Hellomynameis99: About 20 comments have disappeared...
1391843078 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, Yes but this is the only time I've seen it disappear, other times it just moves around. I pmed Surikaten maybe he knows!
1391842889 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, very strange... Have you tried warning anyone else?
1391842742 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, Yeah same here!
1391842714 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, I can't actually see the warning badge anymore
1391842656 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, Yeah, the warning badge should move to the correct location if you reload the upload. I've noticed it too :-)
1391842560 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, oh I'll see what happens later on, anyways can you see the upload on the mod board? If so please tell me, does my waring look weird? For me the waring symbol like moves around! 
1391842460 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, Awesome! Just remember that Lil518 won't get your warning because they can't access the moderator board.
1391842373 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, I warned the user that kept on using inappropriate language, I haven't really thought about anyone else's comments for they're not that offensive. :-)
1391841748 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, excessive inappropriate language you might want to issue the poster with an official warning using the blue spam button.
1391841699 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, Nothing is wrong or right :P

With the users that have used inappropriate language, just reply to their comment and tell them that they shouldn't use inappropriate language, then use the blue spam button to remove the comment.

It's really up to you what you do - if a comment is a few months old, you might decide to delete it without notifying the original poster, or if there is
1391841490 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, oh do you mind helping me in pm? Like telling me what's wrong and what's right? :)
1391841426 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, Oh, I see the issue :-)

We usually try to avoid moving uploads to the moderator board as users who have favorited the post can still view and comment on it, but that doesn't really matter :D
1391841401 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, should I warn? Or should I just delete the comments with the cussing etc?
1391841296 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, I don't think there's a problem with the blocking - users are allowed to block anyone they want. Good spotting on the cussing though :-P
1391841192 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, I just uploaded something to the mod board, it's an upload I found the uploader is blocking random users and another user is cussing, I'd delete the comments but I thought for a sec. Help? I'm still learning some of this. :-)
1391841042 Hellomynameis99: @MCRBGAMING, Congrats on the position!! :-)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask any of us here, or you can upload a thread to the mod board. Looking forward to working with you!
1391824599 Hotline_101: @MCRBGAMING, welcome to the team MCRB! Looking forward to working with you!
1391824003 toughguy42: @MCRBGAMING, congrats!
