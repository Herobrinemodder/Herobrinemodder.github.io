<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Blue no sign</h2><p>I commented on this post.  Now, all I see is my comment and that blue circle.  I clicked on the circle but it won't go away.  I can't see any of the other comments made.
By the way, took me 4 tries to upload this.  Kept trying to resize but froze.  Finally worked when I reduced the images to 1200x1200.</p><img src=Blue_no_sign1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Blue_no_sign2.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Blue_no_sign3.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Blue_no_sign4.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
