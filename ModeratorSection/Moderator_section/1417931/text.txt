I commented on this post.  Now, all I see is my comment and that blue circle.  I clicked on the circle but it won't go away.  I can't see any of the other comments made.
By the way, took me 4 tries to upload this.  Kept trying to resize but froze.  Finally worked when I reduced the images to 1200x1200.
