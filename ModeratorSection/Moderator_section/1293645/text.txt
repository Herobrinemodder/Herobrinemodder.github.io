Okay so as many know that there are a ton of screen shot uploads in the forums section, and i think we should start moving them to the offtopic>art section, since many claim throwing a Instagram filter on a tree is a work of "art" and therefore should be placed on the art section so the forums isn't over filled with these screenshot uplaods....
