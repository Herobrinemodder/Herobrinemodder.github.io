1419152839 bubblybabs: @Pykirknh, yeah, that's what it's doing.
1419152791 Bob Ross: Comments stack lol
1419152767 bubblybabs: @Pykirknh, actually, any comment does that it seems
1419152745 bubblybabs: @Pykirknh, I saw that. The warning overrides the comment below and your avatar doesn't show at first.
1419152665 Bob Ross: Also comments
1419152651 Bob Ross: Warnings get really weird when you post them...try warning someone you will see what I mean
1419152611 Bob Ross: Ok...
1419152600 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, testing if warnings work
1419094142 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, 
I'the ISS. I'd love to send a lot of them there.
1419094095 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, Haha, I'm only paraphrasing what he said, anyway, he should catch the next shuttle to space and build himself a pod on the International Space Station. 
1419094018 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, ya, I agree. Hey! That's not censored enough!
:-)
1419092735 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, if he's f*cking tired of humans... He should leave the earth. :P
1419085233 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, oh, ok.
1419083951 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, 
I bet that's goopgaming. The profanity has been removed but their avatar still says the f word.
1419083460 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, ok. Was it appropriate for me to email?
1419083318 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, should I have sent him a PM instead of emailing JN?
1419083278 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, how can you tell?
1419083233 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, 
Just got email from JN. They are giving a warning, then may ban.
1419083007 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, ok. I thought leaving it up for JN to see was better but your right, I had the evidence.
1419082703 bubblybabs: Looks like it's gone. Oh, or did someone recommend that page for deletion?
1419082533 bubblybabs: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, 
Ok. I didn't want to give the attn or tip them off we knew but I really wanted to say something.
