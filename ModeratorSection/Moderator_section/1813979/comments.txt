Good points
1450427955 Hellomynameis99: PM sessions are, as their name suggests, meant to be private. Even if all identifiers are removed, I believe PM screenshots should not be posted unless all parties in the PM consent to it being public. Again, "private" is in the name.

So Valimc is posting a screenshot of a PM session. Unless the other user/users participating in the PM agree to it, the upload should not exist regardless of what identifiers have been removed.

Just my thoughts. :-)

I don't know. I just figured that would be ok. Guess it's another email to ask JN. I hate bugging them.
