1400572833 Hellomynameis99: Doesn't seem too bad - it's not directed at anyone or causing hate. Just notify the user and ask him to remove the language. If he doesn't, remove the upload after a day or two.
1400572264 Bob Ross: Burning*
1400572250 Bob Ross: It's funny, he's not even trying to cuss he just likes hiring trees
