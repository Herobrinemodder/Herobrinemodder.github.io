<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Report spam!</h2><p>Okay so as long as i can remember we've had people that report every little thing violating the rules, and also every single comment on a post. Like a top 25 posts a seed and hundreds of Steve's spam the post so as a result we get 20+ reports from a single user on a single post. So i was thinking we have report option that they can click that says *multiple offensive, multiple ads, multiple spam comments* so we know to deal with them with out having to go through 20 reports.
And also what falk talked about, being notified when it hits a specific number so the reports don't over flow.</p><img src=Report_spam_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Report_spam_2.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
