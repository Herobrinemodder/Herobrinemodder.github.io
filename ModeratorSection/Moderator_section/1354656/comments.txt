I dunno, I kinda thought the prancing pretty humorous myself. I could imagine it, yup.
1418205726 Bob Ross: Ranting*, sorry for the prancing silly autocorrect
1418205709 Bob Ross: Prancing and hating on an app for kids, very time wasting
1418205684 Bob Ross: They're just wasting their life
1418205633 Bob Ross: LEL what nubs they gonna get rekt by the ban hammer little scrub lords
1418140218 Frios10: Now we're getting somewhere
1418123014 bubblybabs: Sent JN an email.
1418111360 TheCanadianFluffy: @Frios10, Agreed. Let the ban fest begin!
1418109571 Frios10: Let's just ban them all. They all have history and clearly want to find every way possible to test us. Plus if it's not allowed in comments and threads why should it be allowed in links? It's not like those are there actual accounts
