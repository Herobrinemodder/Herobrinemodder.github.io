Some very good points
1456557432 Hellomynameis99: I recently got an email from JN about the update, I'll post that soon.

For reasons I'll explain there, JN aren't removing moderators.

I do, however, think JN need a public relations department, or at least someone to tweet on Twitter more often (the last tweet I saw was from July 2015), post a regular seed or news blog on the Minecraft Seeds account and reply to comments. JN is currently invisible to the community, and I think some interaction would be good.

The comment by @Jonathan4323. It wasn't the nicest comment but it wasn't nasty so I left it.
1456336086 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, 
Good to know.
1456336053 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, He is potentially bluffing in that case. It is completely out of habit for JN to leave us in the dark...
1456336016 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, 
That I'm well aware of the app updates. I haven't a clue.
1456335909 Hotline_101: Meh. I would be happy if we no longer had to moderate. However, it would be nice if we would receive some warning from JN. 

All the same, Jaffa wants to be a moderator. His attitude shows otherwise. What bluff are you referring to? 
1456335817 bubblybabs: By the way, was my bluff believable?
