Hey guys,
The majority of reports today circled around this user, who is repeatedly using profanity in loads of creations. He replied to me after I issued him a warning and said he wants to start anew with a new account, but wants to get banned on this one.
Here's some screenshots of his comments using profanity before I deleted them. I say he deserves a ban as there were more threads I did not screenshot with his profane comments.
