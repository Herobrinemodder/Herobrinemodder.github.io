1419823261 DimplesCS: @TelepathicGrunt✯*, yup, but he didn't understand me when i explained how i can do it...
1419823209 Hotline_101: @Wolfdata0521, yeah, I was wondering if there was a backstory to this.
1419823184 DimplesCS: I answered one of his reports, only to find out that i am a worldwide hacker somehow... The things you never know about yourself :P
