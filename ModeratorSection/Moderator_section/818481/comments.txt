1383001974 Surikaten.: @Hotline_101, yeah this is indeed really strange. Shouldn't work to type in those comments. Will take a look at what messed up asap, nevertheless he's been banned :-)
1383000413 Hotline_101: weird, I tried using the words, and they are all blocked
1382905422 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Hacking? He claims to work for JN, or 4J Studios (Whichever sounds better for the situation) and he said some comment that he's Tobuscus

1382843516 Hellomynameis99: Picture 3 - D**k and Aśs are both blocked by the filter, but he can still use them?!

This needs to be looked into beyond a ban... How is he getting past the filter?
1382843237 Hellomynameis99: He can say f*** but has to use ÿ in you?
1382838937 Hotline_101: I'm not gonna ask how he's suddenly able to say "F***", might be a profanity filter bug
