<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Clarifying</h2><p>Hello moderators,
Just to clarify the name changes, here is a list (sorry if we annoy you by changing names, we won't change them again).
Alex is again, Pykirknh
Andrew is now  oʞʇnɥɐzzıd
It all involves a bet, some root beer, 10 quid, and some Legos.
We won't trade our names for anything else again, sorry for being hard to track.
