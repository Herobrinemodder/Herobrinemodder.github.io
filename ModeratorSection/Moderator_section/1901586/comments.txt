1456686403 Hotline_101: I'll actually be happy to do less work on here. It is more of a chore. 
1456602107 bubblybabs: Think of the fights we won't have to clean up!
1456582211 Frios10: I think this will definitely help with spam reports that can be solved with a simple block/ignore today, but usually aren't.
