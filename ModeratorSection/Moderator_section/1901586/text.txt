Short answer: No
Long Answer: Kinda.
The planned update greatly decreases moderator workload through:
- Giving users 100% moderation access on on their personal uploads
- Giving users the ability to moderate comments on their public uploads (given the comment is downvoted enough)
- Giving users the ability to move their uploads once (given a moderator (yes, moderators will still exist) has not already moved it)
- Improved spam filters
Additionally, JN will monitor how the new features affect the app and continue to provide updates to fix any issues you might find.
So while your workload will decrease (that's a good thing!), Seeds Pro will still need active moderators. Hopefully that includes you!

Heya :-)
 
What we are currently working on in the app is a means to decrease the workload for the moderation aspects of the app altogether. This is because when we originally implemented the (reporting) feature, we did not expect this surge in reports at all.
 
Since then, the workload has increased dramatically and become more of a chore than something we wished to be a conveniency feature for all the mods in the app. Additionally, if we try to combat the reports with more mods, the amount of reports will just increase, and thus require more mods, and some might tire out, and thus creating a spiral which we do not deem optimal.
 
So with the next coming update, we will instead first be introducing a whole host of new features that will let ALL users better moderate their own uploads in a much more effective manner, while at the same time not compromising any quality in the app at all.
 
In specific, the new features will include:
 
- Ability to moderate your own Personal uploads 100%.
- Ability to moderate your own public uploads only IF a comment has received more than x amount of downvotes.
- Ability to move your upload once, if it hasn’t been moved by a moderator already.
- And lastly, of course more robust backend measures to prevent spam and 100% foreign comments from making their way directly onto the app.
 
So hopefully, all of these new features will result in a decreased amount of reports in the app and decreased workload altogether.
 
As soon as the new features roll out, we can proceed to see how the moderation of the app can further develop, and based on that, if needed, we will most DEFINITELY look into implementing (other features) as well, as we’ve been considering it as an essential thing for report responses for a long time now - its just that these revamps have consumed a lot of time and we want to roll them out first before adding features to a system we want to revamp as well :)
 
 
Regarding when the next coming update rolls out - as soon as our BRAND NEW Minecraft Multiplaying & Commands Center hits the stores!! :) Do stay tuned for it!
