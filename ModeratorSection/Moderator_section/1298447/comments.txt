1412043128 TheCanadianFluffy: That does look weird... Anyways, I say its fine as long as no major fights. Move to private I guess.
1412042036 bubblybabs: Ok, over-react then. Tis nice to get several opinions.
1412037240 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, I'm a white American, some Americans get really annoyed with things like that, it's probably because it pictures Obama as white.
1412027456 bubblybabs: My thoughts are it's switching colors and in America the white/black thing is an issue (I say that because I don't know where you live). To me it's no biggy but to others it is. Were they orange and blue it would be different. At first I thought "big whoop" but then I thought about it more and reacted. Then I realized I should have asked you all first. So, a pow-wow now ensues.
1412026700 Hotline_101: How is that racist? It's just White Obama... Some people these days :P
