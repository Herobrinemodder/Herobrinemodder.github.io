A lot of us moderators on the PM group have recently considered the fact that bans do not seem to come at a very opportune time, for example, it may take many days for a user (Even one severely abusing) for you guys at JN to actually get a message or an email about a user...
Idea #1 : Moderators can Temp Ban users
One idea, is that moderators can temporarily ban a user from commenting, or posting posts (As would come in handy with our fringe pornography Steve) 
Perhaps there could be the option to ban a user from commenting on ALL posts for say, 12 hours...
Ban users from posting for say, 2 days (This would be handy for those who upload very inappropriate posts) 
Now, a way to balance this feature (To avoid a single moderator going rogue and banning a user from commenting or posting because they hate them or something) is to activate this ban, three moderators MINIMUM, must approve a ban on a user (Exceptions for JN staff) again, this would avoid a single moderator 'rogue banning' people :)
Idea #2: Users receive the ability to move their OWN posts, in case they accidentally post it into the section.
I think feature #1 would also require the moderators to work together a little more, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Input guys? Anything to add to this feature idea (Or issues with these features) is welcome!
