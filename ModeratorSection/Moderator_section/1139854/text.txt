Hello fellow moderators! That time of year has come again, when JNInteractive prepare to appoint some new moderators and bring in new blood! Surikaten. said he was going to post this a few weeks ago, however, considering nothing has happened, I decided I'd post it :)
Just put your input on candidates you think would or wouldn't be good as moderators, your opinion is wanted :)
If you want, you can add, or validate candidates that other moderators make.
