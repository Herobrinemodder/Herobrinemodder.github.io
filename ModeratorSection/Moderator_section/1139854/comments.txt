1404593739 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yes, although I'm a bit in the blind about MLT I haven't gotten to know him very well
1404564834 Hotline_101: Telepathic, SF, and MLT, all seem like top running candidates 
1402158156 Frios10: Turtleman is also pretty good and reports everyday almost every hour
1401978808 Hellomynameis99: Yep, Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt™ is a pretty good candidate. 
1401976411 Hellomynameis99: ⚡MasterCrafters9000⚡ expressed his interest in moderating to me. He seems pretty nice and mature, but I don't know much about his history. Thoughts?
1401973678 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, Lol :~P
1401973663 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, Oh haha. Looks like I don't read either :-P
1401973132 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, I said I didnt read the comment, sorry :~P
1401972753 Frios10: @TheCanadianFluffy, sfdude is still interested but doesn't think that we care
1401956446 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, Hmm, I agree that sfdude is still a good candidate.

When you suggest users, use separate comments so we can upvote/downvote respective comments :-P
1401939852 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hotline_101, Yeah I agree. Those are just users I know trying to become one in case anyone has something to say about them :~)
1401939365 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, Black Death isn't a great candidate 
1401939349 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, agree about MLT, I've known him for a long time, and he is quite settled 
1401939226 TheCanadianFluffy: Didnt really read the up vote down vote thing. Sorry it wont work with mine :~P
1401939185 TheCanadianFluffy: and I dont know much about Red Dog Red.

Sorry for this massive comments! 
1401939149 TheCanadianFluffy: Hodgi Gaming™, The-gamer-wolfet,Black Death 1313,Red Dog Red are also people I know trying to become mods. Yesterday Hodgi was put on the list by me since he couldn't email. He made a mistake by telling someone not to cuss when they didnt. I don't know what happened. Wolflet seems to like attention, Black Death posts uploads in the wrong section and posts sometimes inappropriate memes...
1401939109 TheCanadianFluffy: 3. Sports_Freak04 AKA Football_Freak04 (previously known as The_Minecraft_Mob_Slayer

He is funny fairly popular nice and can be very pushing. Reports alot. Over all pretty good minus his pushiness. Almost done!

4. MLT™

Has to be my top candidate. He has been working to be a mod for a while. He is nice and is active quite a bit but currently at a camp so not as active. Done!
1401939083 TheCanadianFluffy: 1. sfdude

I was surprised she wasn't appointed last time. I believe we all think she is a good candidate :~) She seems to be giving up on SP though.

2. ?Turtleman? AKA Cabbageguy 47

He has 2 accounts but anyways. He is calm,nice and reports alot. I have never had any issues with him. So he seems good!  More suggestions coming
1401937801 TheCanadianFluffy: Well I have 10+ users I PM who are trying to become mods. This should be fun XD And long...

First up, I have to say I do not think Nicklas 97 should become a moderator. He seems pretty long and immature like hotline said. Down voted.

As for Telepathic Grunt. Seems like a pretty good candidate. Follows the rules and I have seen no reports about him :~) 

And now for my suggestions...
1401929894 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, excellent idea :)
1401921468 Hellomynameis99: If someone suggests a user you agree with, upvote their comment! :-)
1401903213 Hotline_101: Input welcome!
1401903195 Hotline_101: Telepathic Grunt
-----------------------

An interesting suggestion from a lot of people on the app was Telepathic Grunt, he has excellent upload quality, and has stuck to the app rules very well :)


1401903123 Hotline_101: Nicklas 97
---------------

Not the most mature user ever... He had some weird posts and a lot of hate threads against other people, he means good, but he is a little iffy, the "mean disease" was part of the weirdness, I believe JN are partially considering him, I would suggest that he matures a little before becoming a moderator
