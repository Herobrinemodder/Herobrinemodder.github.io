Either this guy or one of you deleted that upload so the link won't work.

I'm going to sleep now. Got to work tonight.
1418570675 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, I don't know, that's a good point...
1418570598 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99_, 
Ok. Sounds good to me. I had wondered about that but worried we'd get accused of censoring.
1418570527 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, I've just realized something... We should be moving all these willow threads to private. Them being under the public eye is probably half our problem!
1418570506 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99_, 
Thing is, I remembered him saying it and looked for it because I couldn't remember his name. If others remember someone admitted to it they'll look for it as well.
1418570431 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99_, 
Ok.
1418570396 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, Ok, great. I had a look and I'm content for it to stay - anybody that wants to read it has to scroll down to the very bottom of a multi-page thread, which I don't think many people do.
1418570323 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99_, 
I sent a message asking him if he wanted me to delete it but I'm very concerned.
1418570279 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, it's not our job, but I think we must. There's a lot of people who'd want to attack DiamondFighter64, including this MJ-1000

So very true.

Here is where they guy who reported to me and got the ban going admits to it. Should we delete his comment for his protection? It's the very first comment.

1418570035 Hellomynameis99: "Whoever reported willow"

Hah, many people reported her...

This has turned out to be a far larger problem than we first thought. Willow spread her insidious roots further than we imagined.

As soon as I get home I'll email JN about this stuff. I'm at work now.
