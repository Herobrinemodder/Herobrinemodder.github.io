1405158359 Hellomynameis99: I've bumped a recent thread by Hotline concerning a similarly named user (Captain_Shay_Sparrow) who was banned earlier this week. Apparently Captain_Shay_Sparrow has the same IP/is the same person as the user 'Shay is an idiot(true!)'.

Anyway, go check out Hotline's thread (This guy needs an IP ban) and see if you can draw any connections and conclusions.
1405148226 AndrewDill: I think that we're going to have to IP or device ban ShayTM.She said in a comment on"seeds://sQN2EDM5ETM_"that if she was banned she will make a new account and be worse so we're going to need to make sure that doesn't happen.
1405146881 AndrewDill: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt™,Yes,TM seems to be the only one causing trouble but TM is accusing regular of doing stuff.
