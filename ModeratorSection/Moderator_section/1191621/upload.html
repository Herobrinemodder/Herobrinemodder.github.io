<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>"Shay"</h2><p>So I don't really know what's going on here but it doesn't look good.If any of y'all know more about what they're talking about feel free to fill me in.What I got out of this is there's a regular shay(pic 3)who's getting accused of doing something by TM shay(pic 4).TM shay also appears to be planning to accuse regular shay's friends of something.There's also talk about cops being at someone's house but I think that's just baloney.I don't know enough about this situation to know if or who to recommend for banning so I'm hoping some of you know some more about this.</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-12/_Shay_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-12/_Shay_2.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-12/_Shay_3.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-12/_Shay_4.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-12/_Shay_5.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/07-12/_Shay_6.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
