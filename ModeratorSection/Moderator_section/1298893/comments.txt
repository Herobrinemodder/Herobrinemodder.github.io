1412087887 DimplesCS: You lost my attention with that picture.....

But in all seriousness I agree a good majority are either pointless or they are minor like "wtf how'd you do that" or as mentioned all from the same post...
1412084397 Hotline_101: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, True enough 
1412084364 Hotline_101: Yeah, someone reported a comment that simply said

'Lie'
1412064802 Hellomynameis99: There are many reports about minor issues - these I simply delete with a report response of "Your report has been resolved, however in the future use the ignore and/or block features for small issues like this. Thanks for your report! :-)" or "Please use the ignore and/or block features for small issues like this. Thanks for your report! :-)" depending on severity.

It would be nice to let users know more about when they can favor these features over reporting.
