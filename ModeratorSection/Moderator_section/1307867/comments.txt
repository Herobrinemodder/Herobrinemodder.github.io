1413034722 bubblybabs: Neat! I like that tap to view if there's an extra message. So, if I add an extra message it's a tap to view. But if I don't add an extra message it doesn't say tap to view, right?
1413034201 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99_, 
Ok, just reported this post
1413031329 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, Nope, you can still select resolve and also send a message. Only one notification is sent - try reporting this comment and I'll resolve and reply to it as an example.

Also, you should note that there might be features that rely on correctly marking reports as deleted or resolved implemented in the future. I suppose we'll talk about that again if/when that happens. :-)
1413026266 bubblybabs: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, 
Good to know.
Oh well, made lots of acquaintances doing that.

So, if I want to send a personal message, click delete.
