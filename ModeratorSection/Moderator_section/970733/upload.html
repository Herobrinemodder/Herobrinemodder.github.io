<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>JNinteractive</h2><p>Most of us have encountered this guy. I don't find any problems with this user sporting the name 'JNinteractive'. For all we know, he could be showing his support for the app.
However, in picture 2, we move on to the topic of his one and only upload, stating that he is JNinteractive. Obviously a drastic ploy to gain followers, to which only three users have succumbed to as of yet.
This, on the other hand, is something I won't stand for, but that's just me. What is your opinion?
I think we want to avoid a ban at this stage. 
Edit:
Forgot to mention that I have moved his upload to private. It's still accessible to us, but should no longer interfere with the public.</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/02-01/JNinteractive1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/02-01/JNinteractive2.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
