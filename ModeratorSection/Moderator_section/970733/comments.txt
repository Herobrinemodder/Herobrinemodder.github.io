1392725844 Mad Man T1zer 53: @MCRBGAMING, what about caps for the beginning of a sentence or for correct grammar?
1391964542 Mcrbgaming: I was just looking at this today, did anyone else realize the user that was using all caps in mostly every comment? I think there should be a filter that changes caps into normal size. It's basically considered spam! :-)
1391270398 Hotline_101: He is Definately a fake, great idea on the (Fake) badge btw
1391244036 Surikaten.: Aand fixed!
1391242167 Surikaten.: Great spotted, we'll deal with it the same way we dealth with the fake Minecraft Seeds accounts, with a (fake) badge next to their names, as we cant moderate the game center names. If we bann this guy he can change his name back to something else ald JN Interactive becomes available for someone else to use again. But we'll add (fake) badges asap.
1391232576 Bob Ross: I have made an official thread warning everyone not to believe that he has any actually power.
