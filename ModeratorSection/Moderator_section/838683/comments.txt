1384531438 kathryncrusher: @#Herobrine#, I respect your choice but I'd hate to see you leave :(
1384529443 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, :(
1384529363 Frios10: @#Herobrine#, hey after school I'll send u an Xbox friend request so we can stay in touch
1384529330 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, if he leaves there's nothing we can do about it it's his choice. I'm going to get back to my regular moderating duties because I actually have time know. I'm sad to but what can we do about it.
1384501660 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, Nuuu! :-(
1384482360 Bob Ross: IDC anymore I'm leaving the app anyways...but that's a good idea for an active user.
1384314874 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, i think it makes it dull we there's a good minecraft post I like it :)
1384269822 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, I've always disliked it, really... But what can you do about it? :/
1384269740 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Even your starting to dislike the non-minecraft junk 
1384127610 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hellomynameis99_, alright then!... checking it more often is now going to happen. lol
1384127553 Hellomynameis99: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf, There's also a story of someone committing suicide... I'm inclined not to believe that, but... Could be true.
1384127396 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hellomynameis99_, o. maybe i should look there more often lol
1384127382 falkirknh: Maybe users have enable off-topic in settings that way people who don't like all the bullying don't have to put up with it
1384127357 Hellomynameis99: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf, that is true, but I had a quick glance at the off-topic section just now. I've seen "Do I look cute" threads, "Stand for gay rights" threads, "My new puppy" threads... Yeah...
1384127206 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: yes but isnt private meant for other users personal life? not the off topic section where people can still bully?
