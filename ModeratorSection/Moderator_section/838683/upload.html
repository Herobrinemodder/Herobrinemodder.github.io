<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Forum Facelift!</h2><p>Recently we have been discussing the forum: it's content, it's users, and how it's addition may have brought the app downhill.
I both agree and disagree with many of the points made. When I first joined the community, I was very active on the forums. I saw many users uploading great threads about minecraft, modding and such.
However, recent trends such as the Roleplay Revolution and Twitter-Style-Texting forums may be what we believe to be bringing the whole forum down. It is rare that I see a minecraft related thread near the top.
So this is my proposal:
Just a small forum overhaul; content uploaded in the Roleplay section and in the Off Topic section should no longer appear in the 'All' category.
If users wish to partake in a Roleplay, they can visit the appropriate subforum/board where they can chat to their hearts content without clogging the main page. The same goes for off-topic. If users wish to see what is going on in other users personal lives, they can drop in to view the Off Topic board.
What are your thoughts?</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2013/11-10/Forum_Facelift_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
