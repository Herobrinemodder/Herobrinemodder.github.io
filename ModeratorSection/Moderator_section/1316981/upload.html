<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>"Mod Helper"/fake warning</h2><p>Don't know who this Sherbet person is.  I set her straight but maybe I should delete my comment to her?  I had no way to PM her in private though.  This was a long, drawn out, petty fight between these two users.  I have snapshots saved of the whole thing if needed.  These two images show the mod helper part with a fake warning.  I didn't know that was a bad, super bad thing to do.
Where the fight was located and my response to this self-appointed mod helper person.
