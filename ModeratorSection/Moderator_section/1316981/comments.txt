1414185056 bubblybabs: She's continuing to do it. I sent her a PM to stop as well as commenting.

1413876857 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, sherbet deserves a little discipline but as long as he got the point just delete the comment. If he comes up again (negatively) in the future then we can start really getting on his case

Idk what a blooming is
1413875959 bubblybabs: @Pykirknh, 
I love that blooming avatar.
Well, anyway, I'm still wondering about my reply I left on the upload. Think I should delete it or leave it there? I'm worried I embarrassed this Sherbet but I was so mad at them for threatening the other user like that.
1413875040 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, a huge mess to clean up, imagine having a user that was your "helper" and then having to "fire" them in PM, and some of us had more then one so it was messy for the users personally and for the community because of the fights that had been raging between mod helper abusers and their nemesis
1413874936 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, well when we published an official list of our own personal mod helpers, everyone wanted to be one to become a moderator. Then, if a user was in a PM with you, they would qualify themselves as "mod helpers" and thought that they carried a certain authority and threw their weight around, abusing and intimidating rivals with a false power.
1413874644 bubblybabs: @Pykirknh, it's sounds like a good idea but I see as problematic if not an official position. And this person was far from mod material
1413874060 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, oh yeah the mod helper idea was started by...me (before I was mod) and a few other mods, but quickly turned to be a huge mistake which brought a lot of headaches and regrets
1413870749 bubblybabs: Oops, forgot.

Where the fight was and my commentary that I'm wondering if I should delete. I wish mods could converse with people via PM without following.
