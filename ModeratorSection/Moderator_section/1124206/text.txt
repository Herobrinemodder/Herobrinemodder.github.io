Hello peers,
I am collecting a list of ACTIVE moderators that are taking REPORTS CURRENTLY so I can tell people who to come to because recently moderator activity isn't too obvious and instead of reporting a bully they do the worst possible, they make a hate thread and get themselves in trouble as well.
So please comment below if you are an active and report taking moderator so I can take your Report Abuse thread links and post them on my future alert post.
That Weird Moderator that Everyone Tries not to Mention,
