<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>App idea</h2><p>Several times I've had a PE seed that looked good in both old world and infinite.
Can it be made so that when one uploads a seed you have a choice between old and infinite worlds?
As it stands, you can upload a seed only once.  I understand the need, but with two different world views it's a problem.</p><img src=App_idea1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
