1398316450 Hellomynameis99: Agh, now Mexican's acolytes are harassing me! :-/ 
1398256895 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., basically, I'm not completely sure I won't be vanishing again
1398256115 Surikaten.: @Hotline_101, it's completely fine :-) Did you get it fixed??
1398216846 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, if he's a billionaire... We are in trouble...
1398216808 Hotline_101: Hey guys, so sorry about inactivity this last week, my Gamecenter has been screwy lately :/
1398180013 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, hahaha, that would say a lot about his priorities :-P
1398179854 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., We could have a billionaire on our hands... He might keep buying new devices until his coffers are depleted. :-P
1398179766 Surikaten.: Sorry for the slow reaction to this one guys! He seems to be switching devices though since we fired him a device bann yesterday and another one today, hopefully he'll run out of devices soon :-) Doesn't seem to be the original MexicanKidd though which is good news :-)
1398175712 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, Hmm, that was my idea too... Owl then said 'sorry' on my Report thread, but only time will tell if the apology was sincere.
1398175639 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Yeah, she did... Very strange, I thought she hated all moderators... 
1398175586 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, JN's already fired an IP ban, but it either hasn't worked or hasn't taken effect yet. I've left another note for Surikaten., perhaps we can get a normal ban issued in the time being.
1398173715 Frios10: Didn't the ender owl ask you out? Lol
1398173692 Frios10: No response from any devs yet. Meanwhile the entire app thinks he's a "hacker" the original wasn't a hacker. He posted selfies i remember that and claimed to be apart of a gang.
1398142589 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, Btw your name is awesome! :P :~)
1398142563 TheCanadianFluffy: Omg so many MexicanKidd_'s with bad intentions. I'd give owl a ban for sure.
1398087192 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Yep, most likely... However, I treat them all the same. :-)
1398087149 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, he an imposter...
1398086957 Hellomynameis99: Poor Hotline might need some help cleaning this mess - seeds://swN5EzN2ATM_

It seems that ender wants to be banned.

Case closed! Let the banhammer speak! :-)
1398086682 Hellomynameis99: This could explain Ender's sudden change in behavior - seeds://sgN3QzM4ATM_
