When I'm responding to a report ticket, the font in the message is so tiny my old eyes have trouble reading what I'm typing.  I tried increasing the font on my iPhone and iPad but the words are still tiny tiny tiny.  (Image1)
Why can't the font be the same size when I'm initially typing in the words as when I icky the send button the first time? (2nd image)
