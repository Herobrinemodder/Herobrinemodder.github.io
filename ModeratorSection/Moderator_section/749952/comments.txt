1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, I always did wonder why they were mods...
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, oh, ok, now I understand 
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hotline_101, it's alright sure, -Gino- and Piraten. also work on the app (Hence why they were appointed to moderators right away). This account is the one used for official uploads and the likes. :-)
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Other then Surikaten.
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Sorry about Asking so many questions, but are there any other developers on this app from JNInteractive?
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Ok
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hotline_101, yes, this account is based on our dev computer and isn't an actual game center account.
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Ok, sorry for any confusion, one last thing, rumour has it that your account is a computer? Is this true?
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hotline_101, alright we'll send a warning for excessive offensive and profane comments and if it continues don't hesitate to email in and we'll take another look at it
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Yes, I think it's Ezmia now, Im not sure if she's still doing it, but from what I've heard, she may still be Ezmia should bring it up
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hotline_101, hmm can't seem to find neither the thread or the user, did she perhaps change name?
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Hmmm, weird :(
Can you ban Smile1432, she's still been causing issues in the "Excuse of revenge"
Im pretty sure Smile The Bully was her second account 
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hotline_101, oh we never got it.
1378940400 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, You never answered my email on it, 
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: @#Herobrine#, It's already out :-) 4.0.2 just hit the App Stores and should patch the bug. We'll stick your thread to the top for reference.
1378940400 Bob Ross: @Minecraft Seeds, hey when is the update that takes away the warning for users going to come out? Some are abusing it and are saying that they are moderators. Also, can you either make a thread about that and make it sticky (top of forum) or can you make mine sticky? I just want people to know its a glitch because some inutils think they're mods.
1378940400 Xxxxxddddd: @Minecraft Seeds, haha. He wants that long vacation :-)
1378940400 Minecraft Seeds: The guy is clearly looking for the bannhammer. He who seeks, he shall find. :-) Banned!
1378940400 Bob Ross: He's also insulted me, called people füčkerš, and said that I should go away.
