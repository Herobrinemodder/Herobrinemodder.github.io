This guy takes the cake, he was spamming on my "Reason for Bolt's Suspension" forum, and seemed to be against everyone, possibly, this guy may be MexxicanKidd, or some random 10 year old who likes what he did, the pics mostly explain themselves :)
I made sure to keep the comments up, and I'm gonna investigate further into him, some of his comments worry me, he seems to think all his "Bully Friends Are Blocked", not sure exactly who he's thinking of....
Input Surikaten or MCSeeds?
