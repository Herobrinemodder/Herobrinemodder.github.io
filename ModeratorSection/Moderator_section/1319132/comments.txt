1414268360 bubblybabs: Ok. Sounds good
1414266859 Surikaten.: @bubblybabs, unfortunately since they are an off topic subject they can be kept in Off-topic, however if one appears to be causing more trouble than good (which happens quite often), the thread can then be moved to Private so it doesn't attract new eyes but the users who still want to talk on that upload can continue on doing so without new users jumping in and reigniting the fights :-)
1414266364 bubblybabs: Actually, I think it would be good to insist all religious threads go to private as well.
1414266317 bubblybabs: @Surikaten., ok. Sounds good to move stuff like this to private.
1414248373 Surikaten.: ...are other offensive things she has done though we could take further actions based on those asap. If she perhaps is creating and causing fights in the comments or bullying other users etc.

Edit: although don't bother too much with her guys - it feels like she'll slip up and violate the rules properly any time resulting in a ban, no need to rant or give her too much attention as that seems to be mostly what she is looking for :-)
1414248310 Surikaten.: Are there any particular threads where she's been violating the rules in? Being an arrogant person like this is not necessarily against the rules - although her uploads like the one linked could perhaps fit better in the Private section as it does no good in the Off topic section (I moved it) and isn't an upload worthy of much discussion. Moving it to Private could give her less attention than she deserves. Although warning her for an arrogant upload could perhaps be a bit excessive, if there...
1414217097 bubblybabs: Am I supposed to PM someone or email JN about this then?
1414198747 Frios10: @bubblybabs, temp ban perhaps. Maybe that will teach her a lesson. She's been a problem for to long
1414196402 bubblybabs: Well guys, a serious question has been completely negated...
1414194881 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, Yeah, same, I hate algebra in general :P
1414194858 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, I hate variables
1414194810 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, 19+x-16b = 47r+ 89
1414194765 Bob Ross: B to the power of 2...?
1414194746 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yes my true age is 193-190 then to the power of 2, then plus 23, minus 18
1414194741 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, We don't even know what B Squared is xD
1414194682 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, a squared plus b squared equals c squared...CMON ITS EASY WHAT IS THIS
1414194662 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, 14 I think, not sure how well I calculated that off of my head.
1414194622 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, Ugh, Algebra xD
1414194607 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, my true age is 193-190 then to the power of 2, then plus 23, minus 18
1414194377 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, Your probably 17
1414194359 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, I'm actually between 19 and 14 GUESS WHICH O_o

And don't be like Teague and say "4"
1414194306 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, lol
1414194290 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, I could have named every teenager ever, but I didn't, plus, your a self proclaimed 20 year old :P
1414194232 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, you forgot me
1414185211 Hotline_101: To end, she is really not even contributing anything good anymore to this app, posts like this really come down to ego, what does everyone else think on this?
1414185122 bubblybabs: But is there anything that can be done in this case? A mod warning won't work.
1414185033 Hotline_101: ... Teens are not like her, it's just that 10% who just annoy me cause they are so... Ugh :P
1414185003 Hotline_101: ... "oh children these days..." 

This combined with her comments makes me want to post a long, truthful, and rant-esk paragraph, but it would do no good probably, at any rate, she's a self centered prig who acts more like a 9 year old then a teen, I'm a teen, I'm not a stuck up douche, Telepathic, Frios, Fluffy, SF, and the vast majority of...
1414184496 Hotline_101: Willow is a self centered jerk, and yes, I mean this, normally, I don't call people this, I really only use it for people who deserve such a name, see her comments, "Do you think Willows is just a big meany pants?" And....
