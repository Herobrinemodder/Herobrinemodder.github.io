For some reason we are ending up with duplicate seeds. I would personally have loved for the seeds database to use the seed_id as a unique identifier (I am aware this is no longer possible) and then register supported versions under the original entry. As it stands there seem to be a number of quirks that can be used to post duplicate seeds. I have found two issues but I assume there are more:
1. Adding white space at end of seed qualifies it as unique. Just strip white space off the end. 
2. If someone has posted the same seed you can just select a really old version and post it there. You could verify the screenshot or just block posting seeds on versions older than 0.8.0
3. if you quickly tap another version you can get it to submit regardless of version availability. This could be resolved by performing a check on the server during the upload submission.
If anyone finds any other issues with the duplicate check, please post them below.
