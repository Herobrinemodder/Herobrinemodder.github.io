Ok, thank goodness. So they were pulling my leg. The person just randomly asked me if we were on a PM session then sent me that info and I had no clue what it was for exactly.
1417446181 Hellomynameis99: PMs can only be viewed by participants with a Seeds Pro client, also known as "the app". PMs can't be seen publicly on the web, although JN do have servers that store your PMs along with seeds, creations and everything else. None of this can be accessed through a web browser, only through the app.

The IP this user gave you is a minecraft server and has nothing to do with how JN handle PMs.
