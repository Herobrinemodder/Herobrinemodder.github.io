1407886491 Hellomynameis99: I think this has really worked... There's less and less off-topic content appearing in the general forum.
1407166113 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., Thanks for your input! Shoutouts are now private. 
1407157675 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, Hmmmm. Private for hunger games? I don't know, I haven't seen any uploads of that type recently.
1407138949 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, Survival Minecraft series?
1407138905 Hellomynameis99: @sfdude, If it's not related to Minecraft, I don't think it should be in the forum section
1407133516 notsfdude: I think follower milestones should be forum/off-topic. Every 1000 followers I earn, I post a milestone in forum, but for the rest I post in private. I assume people are very proud of that milestone and will post in forum. Maybe if it gets too excessive to tell them to only post in forum every big milestone and the smaller ones in private.

Otherwise, I'll start alerting the user in the comments why I have moved their uploads to what section.
1407109230 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, Sure
1407076280 Hotline_101: I've been lazy lately, at any rate, Off Topic is more of a curse then a blessing 
1407073202 Surikaten.: ..It can get 'spammive' and loses the point of the actual shoutout and if everyone posted it to the public boards it would quickly just end up as a race to get as many shoutouts as possible in the Off Topic board regardless of who actually posts the shoutout, just so as many people as possible see the threads and hopefully follows one on :-)
1407073137 Surikaten.: Awesome upload! I agree with most the points made except I'd add that shoutouts should be moved to Private as well, since the objective of a shoutout is for a user to give a shoutout to another user to his followers and ask them to follow one particular user - posting it to the public boards then makes no difference if someone with 5000 followers posts it or someone with 5, everyone will still see the thread and it will just be a thread urging everyone to follow a specific user...
1407070909 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, I'm thinking of the "I got into the Top 25" posts... I just thought that the Top 25 doesn't really relate to Minecraft 
1407070439 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, What do you think about top 25 related posts?
1407070139 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, Hmm, I don't know... I think that hate directed to any user in upload form, no matter how minor, should be removed. If nothing else, it's a waste of a few kilobytes on JN's server. :-P
1407069936 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, I very much agree with that list...
1407069905 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, And hate threads need to be removed, not put in private 
1407069876 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, I think that Minecraft related channels can be posted in forums.
1407068531 Bob Ross: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, totally agreed...off topic.
1407045386 TheCanadianFluffy: I agree with what is said in the post and that is how I move uploads.
1407030279 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, I usually put posts about seeds pro in off-topic - they don't relate to Minecraft.

Some good-quality uploads can stay in general, but shoutouts, follow for follows, user battles, etc can be moved as there are too many of those and they spam the forum.
1407023979 Bob Ross: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, user battles are not really minecraft related and are more often tended to nod towards users, their social status, and popularity, not minecraft essentially.
1407023907 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, how did I get followers I don't do any of those two
1406996900 Hellomynameis99: If the only purpose of a thread is to ask for followers, I think it should be moved to private. People need to earn followers through creative content, not begging.
1406996766 Hellomynameis99: @Wolfdata0521, Hmm, agreed. There's just too many of them and they don't add anything constructive to the Minecraft forum section.
1406996640 DimplesCS: I am also starting to think any post like "100 followers!" Or "follow 4 follow" should be off-topic since they are kinda spamming up forums
1406995984 Hellomynameis99: @Wolfdata0521, Yeah... I thought they would die down last year, but there's more than ever! I don't get what's so attractive about them... ;-P
1406995870 DimplesCS: I am agreeing with the user battles now because everyone is doing it and its spamming up the forums...
