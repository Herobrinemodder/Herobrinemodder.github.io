So...  We've got a user who keeps threatening suicide.  I'm growing weary of it myself.

Then we have another user (who obviously made the account so they could say mean things - look at who they follow) who is voicing their irritation at the uploads and I admit I agree with them.
However, how to stop this suicide stuff without alienating everyone?
