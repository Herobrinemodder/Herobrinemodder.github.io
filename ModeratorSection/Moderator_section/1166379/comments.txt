1403886941 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, great! 
1403886922 Minecraft Seeds: @Frios10, @Hellomynameis99_, bugs! All of these should be fixed now though :-)
1403736966 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Hmm, I've noticed that, due to the fact that moderator uploads are approved instantly, there's a notification for each image uploaded. I once commented on one of Fluffy's threads while the second image was still uploading.
1403733193 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, only one person but I checked and there are no spaces between there PMs, also when someone uploads a in the moderator section it shows it in my notifications repeatedly even if it's just one upload.
1403725302 Minecraft Seeds: That looks strange.. Does this happen to all PMs you receive or only some, or a specific PM session?
