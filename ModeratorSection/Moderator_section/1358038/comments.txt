I emailed JN, they said it was them "hauling though reports in batches". So all is good.

Not cool if it's the latter one.

No TG. That was how many there were last night. I got it down to 73 and then they ALL disappeared. I was doing #74, backed out to check something and all the reports were gone. Within minutes. Either a mod took care of them and deleted them all really fast or a mod deleted them all without working in them. It was between 1:30 and 2am central time.
