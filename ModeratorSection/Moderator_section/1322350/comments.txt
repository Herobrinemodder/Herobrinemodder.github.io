1414627690 TheCanadianFluffy: @Pykirknh, Yes gamecøcks isn't the only reason this started like I said Im not taking sides. Sports is being to harsh and I asked him to stop and I believe TG did too. Gamecøcks is the one causing the majority of the problem though.

1414550544 Bob Ross: @TheCanadianFluffy, Sports freak is also an arsehole but Gamecøcks is a bigger one by FAR...I back up TG
1414505874 TheCanadianFluffy: Gamecocks is PMing me an d saying he is sorry and asking for one more chance. Input?
1414475284 TheCanadianFluffy: Please ban him. Sports freak is my friend and he was PMing me and he got really sad, he is normally the happiest person ever. 

In a more moderator-like way, Gamecocks should be banned. We have had multiple problems with him. I think its time he goes.
1414474852 DimplesCS: @falkirknh, yeah I was thinking the same thing because this isn't the first time we have had issues with Mr.Game
1414474651 falkirknh: Ban. He has no legitimate use for the app.
