<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Seed steal (again)</h2><p>Got a report about "Good Game Dolphins" being uploaded by someone else.  I was curious how that could be because the original seed is definitely still there but if you do a search for it it doesn't come up in the search bar.
[Disregard image 1.  I didn't realize I was in the PC section instead of the PE section]
Image 2 is the original (featured) seed upload by GH_02 uploaded Oct 5th.
Image 3 is the copied seed uploaded Oct 10th.

I've marked the  copied seed for deletion.</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/10-10/Seed_steal_again_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/10-10/Seed_steal_again_2.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/10-10/Seed_steal_again_3.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
