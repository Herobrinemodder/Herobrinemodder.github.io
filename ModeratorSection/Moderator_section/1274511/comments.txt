1409975160 TheCanadianFluffy: Funny how this comes up. A few weeks ago I said "Heyyy" to Black Death 1313 and he told me that. I told him that was stupid and it was never brought up again. Not something I expect to see from MLT but I have seen change in him.

Surikaten is right though. But if he does get inappropriate then a warning is necessary.
1409878683 Surikaten.: Being immature isn't necessarily against the rules though. I don't see anything inappropriate going on in that thread and nothing that should be warning worthy. The thread was also appropriately uploaded to Private so in case they decide to date or do whatever in that thread it is going on in Private and isn't on the public boards. Warn only if the user violates the rules indescriminately - nothing of rule violative nature going on here :-)
