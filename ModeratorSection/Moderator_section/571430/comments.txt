1401895436 Hotline_101: Wait, that comment was useless :P
1401895379 Hotline_101: This was thought of a while ago, JN never elaborated in it though 
1401888344 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, Thats true.
1401867189 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, Hmm, we're able to warn users now, which is the primary reason for this suggestion, I think.
1401856280 TheCanadianFluffy: This does seem good though...
1401852178 TheCanadianFluffy: BWHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHA BUMP
1373065200 Minecraft Seeds: Gotcha. Will look at adding that for the next update :)
1373065200 Hellomynameis99: I agree. A warn feature directed AT a USER, not the uploader, would help a lot.
