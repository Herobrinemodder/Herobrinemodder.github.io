<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Moderator Tool Suggestion</h2><p>Hey guys! I have a moderator feature suggestion! (I don't know if the company scans this section frequently, so this is aimed toward moderators.)

I want to add a new moderator comment feature! It adds a BLUE comment labeled (Featured) or (Important)!!!

It's like a (Warning) comment except BLUE and labeled (Feautured)!

Why it is useful: If you want to answer a question to a user, and you want it to stand out, just use the (Featured) comment! If you want to leave an important message (that acts as a warning) TOWARD A USER (NOT THE UPLOADER OF THE THREAD), use the (Featured) comment!

So do you agree that this is a good idea for a moderator tool? Just comment :-)</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2013/07-06/Moderator_Tool_Suggestion1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
