1483136729 notsfdude: @bubblybabs, I thought more mods were active but I guess they all left... and I'm only active till the end of my winter break :(

Is it just the 3 of us now?
1483136552 notsfdude: @Hellomynameis99, I agree too, there hasn't been an update in more than a year.
1483097523 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99, 
Exactly, I agree with you.  Or even "in 6 months we're shutting down".
1483093834 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, it wouldn't be that bad if we actually knew why they were inactive. Just a little "we'll be on extended break over the Christmas period" or "we've got some life issues we need to sort out but we'll be back February next year" would be nice.

I wouldn't even mind if they told us "We're no longer developing the app because it doesn't make us money, but we'll keep the servers running". At least that way we would actually know what was happening rather than being kept in the dark.

I'm thinking the app and the mods have been abandoned. Way to thank the mods for countless hours of doing service for them.
