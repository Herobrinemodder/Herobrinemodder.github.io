1414468119 Frios10: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, just look up MexicanKidd in the mod board. He wasn't a "hacker" back then. He was the first IP ban
1414467830 Frios10: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, ok lol
1414463855 Frios10: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, actually, that's the myth version. The real one never told anyone he would hack them. He just cussed and said he was apart of a gang. Then came the million imposters that gave him his "hacker" reputation. 
1414463648 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, ohhhhh yeah...he was the number one bully on the app for a few months, what a pain in the gluteus Maximus.
1414461197 bubblybabs: Wow, what a legacy
1414461167 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, Yeah, I don't think he was smart enough to do that though. 
1414461147 bubblybabs: An IP ban is well and good unless they move or change Internet hosts, right?
1414461145 Hotline_101: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, Ditto, however, a ton of people copied his name and idea, the original one couldn't spell very well, and everyone (Myself included) used that to seem like him :P
1414461086 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, They always have, they think he's a ghost or something, he's like the SP Boogeyman 
1414461023 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, interesting. I see people are freaking a bit over them
1414460958 Hotline_101: Ah yeah, he was the reason JN invented the IP ban, he made tons of alt accounts just to bug everyone. :)
