I believe I covered that below
1416024811 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, did you take personal offense because you are pro abortion, or did you take general offense that he was "threatening" to abuse his mod abilities?
1415946175 Frios10: @bubblybabs, ok that's fine, Goodnight
1415946061 bubblybabs: @Frios10, 
Again, you aren't getting it. Your beliefs are fine. We all have them and should be able to state them. But you told people they better not disagree with that post. They should be able to as long as they aren't nasty or break app rules. Then you address the app breaking.
1415945742 Frios10: @bubblybabs, Your not getting it either so let's just call it a night and forget this happened? Sorry if I offended you with my beliefs. 
1415945656 bubblybabs: @Frios10, 
You aren't getting it. You sounded like you are against abortion and no one better disagree with you or you'll abuse your mod position by censoring the thread. I took offense to that.
However, I didn't want to argue with a fellow mod about it publicly.
1415945532 Frios10: @bubblybabs, and I did
1415945521 Frios10: @bubblybabs, ok fine let's let chaos reign in the Realm of public forums. 
1415945485 bubblybabs: @Frios10, then you needed to address the nastiness.
1415945459 bubblybabs: @Frios10, if you put it out there in a public forum, esp something like abortion, it should be expected to get pro and con, for and against comments
1415945450 Frios10: @bubblybabs, and he was getting nasty about it
1415945369 bubblybabs: @Frios10, but that's not the point. I don't mind people disagreeing with me on my atheistic views as long as they don't get nasty about it
1415945361 Frios10: @bubblybabs, tell them keep there believes in there own uploads not other people's 
1415945311 Frios10: @bubblybabs, tell people not to disagree so a fight won't happen
1415945282 bubblybabs: @Frios10, the same what?
1415945121 Frios10: @bubblybabs, the last part meant I would do the same on a atheist thread.
1415940034 bubblybabs: @Frios10, 
Fighting isn't allowed but it occurs constantly on the app and we just try to keep them from getting out of hand.
I'm not sure what you were saying in the second part of your comment. You didn't suggest, you threatened someone and others if they disagreed with the anti-abortion post.
1415939797 Frios10: @bubblybabs, according to the app rules fighting is wrong babs. I suggest telling abortion supporters to ingnore and report anti abortionist on there uploads supporting abortion. Does that offend you to? No right? 
1415931307 bubblybabs: I'm thinking this should go back to off topic because then I'm censoring and I don't believe in that. However, if someone disagrees with his views then they should be allowed to as long as they do it intelligently and according to the rules. 
1415921382 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, I moved it to private. I'm still angry about this.
1415909174 Hotline_101: The point is true, abortion IS murder, at any rate though, it probably will end up becoming a fight trap... Probably move to private for now.. Moment, I didn't see what section it is in..,
