Oh, yes, I knew it was ok to change his name back. I wanted to know if it was ok for him to impersonate. 
1421234764 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, it's ok for him to change his username back, it's not ok for him to impersonate Bella. Hopefully he didn't mean anything by it :-)
1421211556 bubblybabs: Ok, it's a user Knighmare 159! He switched back to his usual user name. Is that ok for him to do?
