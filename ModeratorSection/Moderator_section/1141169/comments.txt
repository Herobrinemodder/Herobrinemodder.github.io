1402474296 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, lucky...
1402234683 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Yeah, I can't deal with the 50 Love RPs over PM either lol
1402156837 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, If it was on a report thread, I'd come to your aid, but as it's PM I don't se how I can help... :-/
1402156584 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, oh snap, Quartz Miner gave me a giant load of Love RPs over PM, waaaay to much for me to take on alone xD
1402156057 Hellomynameis99: Telepathic just gave me a few hundred reports... If nothing else, I'd want him as a mod so he doesn't do that to me again!! :-P
1402119863 Frios10: @Hotline_101, I'm posting my interview with sf soon
1402119846 Frios10: @Hotline_101, XD it autocorrected i meant received
1402119776 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Uh... Frios, problem? This has nothing to do with Fluffy
1402113532 Frios10: @Hotline_101, come on
1402113521 Frios10: @Hotline_101, fluffy has revived many reports and I got three from her though PM. She's more focused on the good of the app rather then seeds.
1402106899 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I thought you were speaking of MCRB :P

The whole "she wouldn't be on for a few days" sounded a lot what MCRB told me
1402094555 TheCanadianFluffy: Talk to sf, she sent me a ton of reports today.
1402073475 Frios10: @Hotline_101, sf is a girl hotline
1402069266 Hotline_101: @Frios10, he*
1402061876 Frios10: @Hotline_101, she's actively reporting 
1402061861 Frios10: @Hotline_101, actually she said she wouldn't be in a few days.
1402061489 Hellomynameis99: @Mcrbgaming, hehe
1402060889 Mcrbgaming: @Hotline_101, Hm?
1402060756 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I also agree with that, EXCEPT, she is inactive to an extent, like MCRB seems to be
1402024702 Frios10: And I don't know...I mean fights are really easy.

Step one. Warn everyone to get off the page

Step two. Take screenshots if necessary and if not necessary make sure fighting is over.

Step three. Post screenshots to mod board if you took them along with deleting the post if necessary

It's that easy and it works
1402024455 Frios10: Sfdude definitely 
1402006712 TheCanadianFluffy: Seems solid. I think you should talk to ?Turltleman? Idk if he is serious but he seems good to me. I may ask Sports_Freak04 about it. See how pushy he gets...
