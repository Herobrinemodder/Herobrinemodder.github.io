<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Bugs</h2><p>Hello moderator peers,
I have noticed 2 major bugs that have been affecting me, but I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this.
1. (In picture 1) is the comment dates...they're all jumbled up as you can see with 10 hours ago above 1 minute ago...it's not that I put most popular comments, as you can see all of them are just the person who commented.
The second bug is that if I try to comment on a post with no comments yet, it will say "Please wait for the comment sections to load", but it never does PLUS I have tried exactly 14 threads in different categories (skins, forums, etc), and it's always the same.
Have any of you experienced any of these recently?
edit: I can't even comment on my own post so PM me or join a mod chat and talk there. Sorry.</p><img src=Bugs1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
