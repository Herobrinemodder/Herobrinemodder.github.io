I'm livid with this user.  I'm worried I'm over-reacting because my dad just died of cancer 3 weeks after being diagnosed and we just had his funeral on Nov 7th.  I don't think I am.
Patients dying of cancer aren't typing stuff into an app the day they die.  They're too busy dying and are in lala land.
