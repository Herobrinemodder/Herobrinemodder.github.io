<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Modified cussing</h2><p>I'm just getting back into moderating after taking care of my sister who was ill with cancer so please make exceptions for me as I get into the swing of this.  I don't know if we all receive the same warnings or if they are divided up between us all.
I received some complaints about cursing.  One I gave a warning to the person for cursing someone out negatively even though they modified the F word.  However, this is using a curse in a positive manner so I'm not sure if a message or warning should be sent.
How kid friendly are we to be?
Thanks so much,
