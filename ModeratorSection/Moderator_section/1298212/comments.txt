Sorry, I meant comments.
1412676711 bubblybabs: @AndrewDill, I agree. I'm not sure where to draw the line so I'm just getting rid of them all if they are old posts so there's no more reports about them and asking others to refrain from using profanity even if modified and then I delete their post. Am hoping I'm doing right.
1412660866 AndrewDill: ...cet ever possible "*"and letter combination with the filter,but people typically replace the 1st vowel of the word.Also how far can people go?would we consider "d******" language?
1412660686 AndrewDill: This has always been a grey area for me when moderating. Would replacing a letter in a cuss word with an "*" still be considered against app rules?If it isn't,then we need to make an announcement that it is ok so that people will stop reporting them,but If it is then we need to make the filter pick them up to.(Our made up cuss word example is "dapelob" (pronounced dâp-el-ōb).If we do consider it cussing then d*pelob should be picked up by the language filter yes?I know that we couldn't dete...
1412043518 TheCanadianFluffy: Sorry for your loss bubblybabs -And Im sure no one would think you would do that. Welcome back though :~) Seems Wolf,hello,Telepathic and Hotline covered all I had to say!
1412005222 bubblybabs: Thanks for the info. The modding is quite different from when I first began. So many more options and so much better! Thanks for the condolences also, you are all very sweet. Please don't see my comment about my sister as a ploy to get attention, with 4 kids I get enough attention! :-). Thanks again. I'm going to read a lot of mod posts to familiarize myself with everyone and everything.

1411998960 DimplesCS: Sorry to hear about your sister, but welcome back! 

Like the others said it depends if they direct it at someone if you'll issue a warning, i most often delete them if they are something simple.
1411998060 Hellomynameis99: You have my condolences - I'm sorry to hear that. Adding on to what the others said, just reply to the user and let them know that cussing is against the rules. If, as Telepathic said, the cursing is directed at someone, issue a warning to the user.
1411997123 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, welcome back! Probably best (As Telepathic said) to remove the comments.
1411991605 bubblybabs: Thank you for the speedy reply. Do you reply back to the person who reported the issue saying it's been taken care of?

Sadly, my sister passed but it's for the best as she was in pain (cancer). Thank you for asking.
