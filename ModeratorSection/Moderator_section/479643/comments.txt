1402094492 TheCanadianFluffy: @Frios10, These bumps...
1402081488 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, you posted that comment more then a year ago!
1402081447 Frios10: Bump
1370473200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, sorry, I'm back. You may have noticed I put your suggestions up on the Watchlist thread...

:-)
1370473200 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, and Hellomynameis99_ is ignoring me. I have talked to him in the mod board and his uploads about 30 times and he hasn't answered me...the comments have been up for two days :(
1370473200 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, ok :)
1370386800 falkirknh: @#Herobrine#, I know but it's best just to report the seed and not clear comments. Your action was justified though and in no way wrong :)
1370386800 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, I only deleted one seed's conversation , and the upload was "Suck a d****"
1370386800 falkirknh: @#Herobrine#, it annoys users
1370386800 falkirknh: @#Herobrine#, Please only clear cussing or bad comments not whole conversations :-)
1370386800 toughguy42: I must sound really childish
1370386800 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, it things like this that worries me. It's so sad what this world has come to. You can't do anything or look anywhere without seeing something you don't want to see! It's like nyan cat is the only good song, and the Hokey pokey is the only good dance! 
1370386800 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, People do it because they disslike people, sinful nature 
1370386800 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, lol
1370386800 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, I don't like waiting. That's why I got faster Internet! : )
1370386800 toughguy42: WHY'S THE POINT IN CUSSING?!? Does it make themselves feel more mature? It has no reason! 
1370386800 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, Yah, that's what we mods have to do, learn patience 
1370386800 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, it wouldn't help. In fact, users would get mad and it would be worse
1370386800 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, Im almost ready to post a warning on every squid and Budder forum with "Please delete this thread or violate app rules"
1370386800 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, xD
1370386800 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, Or the AO should ban the words so no one can say them
1370386800 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, it's like we should ban the use of the words budder and squid. It's bad
1370386800 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, Yes, the budder noobs and the squid jerks are waging total war and tearing this app apart 
1370386800 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, it's horrible. It keeps popping up more and more. 
1370386800 Hotline_101: Oh wow, that's..... Sickening, as you said.... Sky seems to create chaos wherever he pops up, I even saw a sky p••n thing on Survival Craft's downloadable worlds, talk about amateurs (Excuse my language)
1370386800 Bob Ross: I just delete the comments. I think we're going to need more moderators soon...
1370386800 falkirknh: 
I agree
