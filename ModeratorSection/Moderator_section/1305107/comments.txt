1412776012 Surikaten.: Just took a look at his comment history and it seems to have only occured once so far, but as I'm hearing it he's doing it repeatedly by posting the profanity and then deleting it. If he is caught doing it again please bump this thread back up again and we'll fire him a warning for excessive profanity asap.
1412717649 bubblybabs: I sent him a PM to look here.
1412694946 bubblybabs: Ok. I did not see it. In this argument, I had warned The Ghost because I saw their profanity in the comment section but didn't see this as it had.been deleted by Tactical Duck before I got to it.
1412694751 DimplesCS: @bubblybabs, I think you can, if you see it yourself. But not if someone else tells you that they cussed at them, but deleted the comments.
1412694656 bubblybabs: @Wolfdata0521, 
Yes, so we'd warn the user about it then. I figured, just wanted to make sure.

But you can't warn them when they deleted it, can you?
1412693767 DimplesCS: I think that's profanity, just another way to say the f-bomb...
