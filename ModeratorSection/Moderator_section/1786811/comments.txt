There needs to be a listing of approval times. Still, to me, if one knowingly posts incorrectly, they need re-upload correctly. Kind of takes the incentive away to post wrong. Sometimes you can tell something was post wrong by accident, when that happens I move it to its correct spot.
1448279736 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, great idea, "re-upload correctly" puts it back to the user, after all, there's nothing else we can do. Thanks for the information!
1448266204 bubblybabs: Below is what I say when I move stuff very obviously put in the wrong spot to private. I just change the part stating where it was moved from. 
1448266089 bubblybabs: Moved from seeds/PE to private.
Reason:
Posts that are obviously uploaded into the wrong area of the app (ex: off topic into seeds, seeds into creations) shall be moved to private.
Why?
People taking advantage of certain loopholes that places a post at the top of a forum once moved. Not to imply this was your exact motive for uploading incorrectly but, sorry to say, a few rotten apples ruins it for all. 
Please re-upload correctly if you wish others to see this post.
