I have no plans on going rogue or anything but I'm tired of Jaffa and the likes of him.  We have no back-up support of the devs so we're left to our own devices.
I will not delete any religious posts, either.  Just in case someone says I did.
I will be uploading Atheist stuff but do not plan to attack religion.  I won't go full-on Militant Atheist because this is a kids app, I just wanted to worry Jaffa.
Just an FYI for you all.</p><img src=Jaffa_Josh1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Jaffa_Josh2.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
