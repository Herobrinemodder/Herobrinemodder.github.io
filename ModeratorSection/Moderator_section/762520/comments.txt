1379779568 kathryncrusher: @Frios10, Yeah
1379773536 Frios10: Now with RPs some are fine but some need to be deleted I personally don't like them they tend to start stuff but there's a section for then so yea.
1379773240 Frios10: @AndrewDill I'm batman
1379773224 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_ actually it's an epic update if you actually KNOW how to use it unlike some people who will go unnamed.....there the first commenters 
1379629232 AndrewDill: I would say all of them,but then again if I had my way more than 95% of all forum posts would be gone,so I guess just leave them since they have their own category anyway.
1379545200 kathryncrusher: Thanks all of you 
1379545200 Hellomynameis99: Now, about roleplays :-)

Don't delete them just because of the title! There is a whole Roleplay section, specifically made for them. You can't delete something that is complying to the rules.

That being said, RPs like the inappropriate one we all saw recently should be deleted. This doesn't mean that every love RP must be deleted, only the ones that have gone too far. :-) 
1379545200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, I'm lucky - I CAN'T get it on my older 4th gen device...
1379545200 Bob Ross: Fluffy, I suggest you delete Love RPs
1379545200 Bob Ross: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, me too it's too advanced and messed up
