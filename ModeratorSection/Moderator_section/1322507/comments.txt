1414547629 TheCanadianFluffy: @bubblybabs, Not a bad idea. I PMd Surikaten. and asked him to look at this issue so we should have this solved soon enough :~)
1414547501 bubblybabs: Perhaps a week long ban to show this is serious stuff?
1414547477 TheCanadianFluffy: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, Yes Im aware. He got in one with a user than decided it would be fun to argue with me when I warned him :/
1414547384 TheCanadianFluffy: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, Yes I saw that and I did talk to sports about toning it down but I honestly think that Sports is trying to give advice - he is just being to harsh. Im not on any sides, both contributed to this fight but I think Gamecøcks deserves the ban for what he did now and his decorated history.

Lets hope surikaten clears this up :~)
1414547205 TheCanadianFluffy: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, Yes we do but we also ban them when they break rules, doesnt always matter if they contribute.
1414547163 TheCanadianFluffy: @Wolfdata0521, Yes, you are defiantly right.
1414547131 TheCanadianFluffy: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, Yes he could of course. I dont think he was but there really is no way to find out.
1414515558 bubblybabs: @Wolfdata0521, I agree. I notice Nighthawk rejoined and is behaving himself (so far). Perhaps that is what this guy needs (I don't like his username either though he'll probably just add more $ to the end of it when he rejoins)
1414510816 DimplesCS: Honestly that wouldn't be fair to other users if he got another chance... He has already had several warnings in the past, and continues to do the things that aren't allowed. He might gain a feeling of invincibility and mess with people again...
