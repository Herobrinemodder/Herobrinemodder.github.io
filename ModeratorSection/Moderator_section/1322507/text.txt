Hey guys!
Gamecøcks is begging me, and I mean begging me for him to not get banned. I think he deserves it but on the other gamecøcks post someone suggested we ban all his secondary accounts and fire him a final warning. It might not be a bad idea but I want this guy to go. This is the third problem I've had with him so I think its time he says goodbye. By the looks of the PM he will probably make a new account after he gets banned but as long as he doesnt bully anyone again it should be fine.
