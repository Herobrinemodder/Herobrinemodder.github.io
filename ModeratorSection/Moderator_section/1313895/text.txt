This copy has a twist.
Seed ID 855934560
GwenL776 uoloaded the seed on 9/26
BlazingLegend5 asked permission to use the seed and GwenL776 said ok.
BlazingLegend5 then uploaded the seed as his own on 10/3 without giving credit to GwenL776.  I left him a comment about that. (Update, I see he did credit her but not clearly and not with her correct user ID).
Got a complaint by someone about a seed uploaded by Plasma7057 named ULTIMATE SEED saying that they copied it (the numerical ID is 855934560).

I know it's easy to change a word ID to a numerical ID, but is it just as easy to do it the other way?
