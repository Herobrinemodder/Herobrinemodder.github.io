1413645750 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99_, ok. That's why I said there was a twist in in this one.
1413640840 Hellomynameis99: @bubblybabs, it's strange, there's really no point in reuploading the same seed again. Blazing's version has a lot more content than Gwen's, however Gwen's is the original. As permission was given, both can stay. This situation hasn't happened too often :-)

Yes, I saw that. That part was written last because that was the reason for my investigating the seed ID.
What about BlazingLegrnd5 asking to use GwenL776's seed? Is that ok?

You can see in the description that plasma has typed what the seed really is:

Tough stuff.

What's happened here is that Plasma has called the upload "ULTIMATE SEED" and given the real seed in the

Well, that's a fascinating coincidence then!
