1401277036 Surikaten.: @AndrewDill, as for the server space, you're right, it does get problematic at times but we clean that up from time to time based on what uploads were made by dummy accounts etc so it's np :-)
1401276998 Surikaten.: @AndrewDill, yep that was sort of, almost the sole purpose of the Off topic section as there were otherwise tons of non-Minecraft related topics clogging up the main Minecraft forum
1401253021 TheCanadianFluffy: @AndrewDill, Yeah I was offline for around a month. My school is out in I think 4 weeks :~)
1401252924 AndrewDill: @TheCanadianFluffy,yea...

Been away longer than I'd like.School is nearly done for me though so I'll be online some more.
1401252798 TheCanadianFluffy: @AndrewDill, Whoa! I saw you comment :~P good to see you online
1401252725 AndrewDill: Off topic section=Forum garbage bin.Anything in the forum section that's worthless gets thrown away into the off topic.I'm surprised that JNI is fine with keeping all of the thousands of off topic threads in their server memory where they would just take up space.I'll keep cleaning up the forums.
1400991882 TheCanadianFluffy: @Frios10, Yeah we have done a good job with it :~)
1400989292 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, As have I :-)
1400987926 Frios10: @Pykirknh, actually the forums change is already noticeable :-) I've been busy doing that today
1400922422 Bob Ross: With only 4 participants...this is going to take a while...
1400907139 Frios10: Alright operation clean the forums is in action!
1400905125 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, Forum Cleanup! Woooo!
1400903925 TheCanadianFluffy: @Frios10, We should have a forum clean up! XD
1400903853 TheCanadianFluffy: @Surikaten., Lol. Have to say it again I see. Now I will get you back x2!
1400902893 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, My thoughts exactly, I'm going to do that right now. Spread the word, in each thread you move, type something like "Just letting you know that I've moved this upload to the off-topic section. If you want to upload something unrelated to Minecraft (Like this upload) please post it in the Off-Topic section, not the general forum. Thanks for understanding!! :-)"
1400902593 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, I think people are overreacting. We should start an operation where we move all unessacary threads to off topic...that would clean up the forums 
1400898774 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, yesh just send them there, because the Forum section should solely be Minecraft related, so whatever isn't can just be moved to Off Topic, or if it is something personal 1-2 users in between to Private even :-)
1400898695 Surikaten.: ...they can just be moved to the Off Topic section, which is its primary purpose :-)
1400898691 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., ... Simply move them to the correct section?
1400898608 Surikaten.: ...topics en masse, too many actually to constantly delete. It was much better to just create the Off Topic section and then move whatever isn't Minecraft related from the Forum section to the Off Topic one instead, and then whoever is interested in checking out some stuff that aren't really Minecrafy related could do so there. It's a win win, so if there are some Off Topic threads in the forum...
1400898597 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., Yup, exactly. I think I remember some discussion of the sort.
1400898385 Surikaten.: Ah I just wrote a story to CanadianFluffy about this in PM, wish I wrote it here instead of all could read :-p

The reason we implemented the Off Topic section was due to the rise in need. It wasn't that long ago actually and I think we had a discussion about it in the mod board. But primarily it was because the Forum section itself was getting flooded by irrelevant and non Minecraft related...
1400897702 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, I suppose to allow people to have a chat with the community they know about things that aren't necessarily about Minecraft. Most forums have an off-topic section to allow members to talk about other things they are interested in.
1400897588 Hotline_101: Why do we even have an "Off Topic" section on a Minecraft app?
