A few of you may have noticed recent threads concerning the removal of the forum systems.
The whole app (or at least people who actually post constructive Minecraft-related threads) is in turmoil. Telepathic reposted sfdude's thread, placing emphasis on removing both the forum and off-topic sections. Many people disagree with this, as do I as there are many constructive Minecraft related uploads in the forums - to remove them would be a shame, as I've said on multiple uploads that address the topic. I suggest we crack down on off-topic threads that are uploaded in the forum section (by moving them to their correct board/section) as that's what seems to be causing most of the grief. Users are thinking the app is straying away from Minecraft.
Other options include:
•Absolute removal of both forum systems
(Nuuu!)
•Removal of the Off-Topic forum system
(I don't think this would help much - users would post their off-topic threads on the main forum)
•Closing both forum systems for a week. If users try to access them, they will be greeted by a message telling them that the forums have been closed for a short time due to abuse. (Suggested on Telepathic's upload)
If this course of action is taken, we would have a week to sort out the forum before putting it back online.
Anyway, enough typing from me.
