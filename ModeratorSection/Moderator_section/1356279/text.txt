Hey guys!
I was wondering if users who are not following me could view a private upload if I have them the link. Unfortunately I can't test this because, as you probably know, moderators can view private threads regardless of who they're following.
That's why I thought of a new feature!
Private and Unlisted Uploads
Private
The current system - only users who are following you can see the upload.
Unlisted
Nobody can see this upload until you give them the SeedsLink. Users are still allowed to share the link, but they would see a message telling them that the upload is unlisted and to think twice and be considerate before sharing. Yep, YouTube.
To post a private or unlisted upload, you would follow the same procedure as you would to post a private upload, except you would get a message box asking if you want to post a private or unlisted upload. A third button would pull up a description of both upload types so that users know who can see each type of upload.
Questions? Comments? Concerns?
That's all!
