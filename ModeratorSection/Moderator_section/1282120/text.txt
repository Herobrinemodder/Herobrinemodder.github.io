For the most part we shouldn't have to deal with the EULA but with the Microsoft stuff going on more changes could be around the corner and it would be nice to be ready. You should read up on the EULA changes and the actual EULA before enforcing EULA compliance.
Enforcing the EULA is the job of Mojang and not our own, this means that you shouldn't go around looking for EULA violations. If you receive report or stumble upon one then you should deal with it though. 
When you find an EULA violating post fire an informal warning on the post and comment a link to the post below. We will give the poster 48 hours to comply with the EULA changes. If at the end of this time they have changes to comply edit your post in this thread to indicate that (you can delete your original warning post if you want). If not then delete the thread and edit your post here to indicate that (make sure to note the poster as that will be lost if you don't). It is YOUR job to check back after 48 hours, this thread is here as a log and to track repeated violations.
Log Comment Examples (for commenting on this thread):
Found an EULA violation:
"seeds://example"
Closed as successful:
"seeds://example is success"
Closed as unsuccessful (thread deleted):
"seeds://example is unsuccessful (posted by ExampleUser)
Example warning comment:
"Your post does not comply with the Mojang EULA (http://is.gd/mcEULA). All uploads most comply with the Mojang EULA. You have 48 hours to update your post or it will be removed. If you have any questions feel free to reply to this comment."
If anyone has any suggestions for improvement to the system please discuss below :)
