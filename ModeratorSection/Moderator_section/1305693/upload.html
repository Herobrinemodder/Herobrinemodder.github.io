<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Profanity and warnings</h2><p>This is in regards to user,Shellyz69.  I have a strong feeling they are very young.
1st image is the complaint they sent about cussing.
The 2nd image shows what they complained about - I saw no profanity but could have been deleted before I got to it.
3rd image is the cussing Shellyz69 had put up long after TG had given them a warning.  I left a 2nd warning.
4th image shows what I came across on Shellyz69 upload comment area that was left an hour ago.  I left another warning.  I came across this one because Shelkyz69 reported someone for being rude.
I mean, hellooooo!, don't report someone for being rude and then leave profanity, esp after having been warned.</p><img src=Profanity_and_warnings1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Profanity_and_warnings2.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Profanity_and_warnings3.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Profanity_and_warnings4.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
