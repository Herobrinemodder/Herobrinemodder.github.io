1400442292 Surikaten.: @Pykirknh, yeah it has, he was warned multiple times for it in the past.

And yesh if the picture is of perverted or sexual and/or suggestive nature. It depends of course from case to case but a picture of a cleavage trying to peak in feels a bit inappropriate. :-)
1400440079 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., quick question should we take down threads that have pictures that show PARTIAL cleavage...but not all? (For example looking down a loose/short bra angle)
1400439812 Bob Ross: I deleted those comments but he's still on a rampage and he does seem familiar...hasn't this problem popped up a long while back...?
1400439741 Bob Ross: He started spouting about me and Fluffy having a relationship and also calling me g a y for watching Doctor Who
1400426169 Surikaten.: He has received multiple both mod warnings and app warnings in the past to no effect. Will take further measures as soon as I get a hold of a comp :-)
