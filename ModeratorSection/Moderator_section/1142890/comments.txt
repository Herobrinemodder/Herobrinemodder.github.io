1402156537 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, I messaged him this morning, he's around, he just hasn't been commenting 
1402150193 TheCanadianFluffy: Seems solid. But really, where is Surikaten?
1402146112 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yes, she (SF) would make a good candidate, I never said she wouldn't, other then being inactive at the moment, which I guess she isn't now, on another note, where is Surikaten?
1402120629 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, indeed
1402120617 Hellomynameis99: As I said... How many months ago? She's a good candidate. 
1402120226 Frios10: Oh and Black Death was asking about "the chosen ones revenge" lol
