1400903768 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, I saw! He went again after though. I saw him saying something was bad to a user too!
1400903628 Hellomynameis99: The word is not profane again :-)
1400900478 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, He is still going now at 2 more people on my thread Gaming W/ Fluffy
1400895049 Hellomynameis99: Yep, I've said that if it's directed at someone, you're still breaking the rules by insulting users.
