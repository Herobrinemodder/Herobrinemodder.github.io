Gav76 is abusing the fact shit is no longer profanity. He first started by directing it to sf. Then to me. Now he is just saying it. He ignored my warnings. For that something should be done. This brings me to my other point...
Surikaten, you should really add shit back to the filter. People are abusing it. And also maybe have a better filter where cussing doesn't slip left and right.
Mods and Surikaten, take a look at sfdudes thread. Some good points/ideas are made: seeds://sgMwkzMyETM_</p><img src=Gav76_Pushing_The_Filter1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Gav76_Pushing_The_Filter2.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
