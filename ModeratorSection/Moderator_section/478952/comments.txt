1410254153 Bob Ross: Who the hell was this
1404297020 Bob Ross: I have an extreme sense of nostalgia reading this
1374274800 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, oh okay :-)
1374274800 AndrewDill: Hey #Herobrine#,you may not no this but at one time we decided that having images of guns was ok.The thread Lol by the"(KING MINECRAFT)"guy didn't contain violence and does not need to be removed.I have already removed your unnessasary warning from that thread.So just FYI,you don't have to remove threads with gun images in them.What we don't want is images with blood,gore,people getting shot,etc.
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, OHHH.
1373929200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, I thought another moderator was appointed, #Herobrine# the 2nd
