1409339258 Minecraft Seeds: A mute report feature is coming up along with the next coming update which will make it possible to effectively mute a specific user from reporting in the case that they are excessively spamming reports without stopping :)
1409060048 Hotline_101: There's quite a few of them lately, Chinese mostly 
1409056669 Hellomynameis99: @TelepathicGrunt☆*ﾟ, Good idea! 

My idea was that we can see reports issued by a user, allowing us to see if they have spammed reports to aid decisions in blocking the user from reporting.

However I like your idea too - viewing a list of reports that have been issued against any particular user. If a report has been resolved, it would appear on the list, and if a report has been deleted it would not show.
1409039793 Hellomynameis99: I think this is where a report history could be handy... Perhaps this feature can be seen from a users profile or an option when taking a report? "See other reports by this user"?
1409039689 Hellomynameis99: I usually reply "Please use the ignore and/or block features for small issues like this." For users that report minute offenses. I haven't encountered too many people that spam gibberish reports though.
