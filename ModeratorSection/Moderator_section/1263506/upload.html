I have taken notice in the recent spamming of the report feature. I ask, what do we do about these people? I have warned some but they keep coming back for more and eventually when I say that they could be muted permanently (bluff, since Nahir hasn't implemented a mute feature), they stop
I don't think this bluff can keep them at bay because more and more report spammers join their ranks every week...
Input?</p><img src=Report_spammers1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Report_spammers2.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
