1390328781 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, the greatest inspiration...
1390322161 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, you wouldn't, I just thought of this because of a hate post :P
1390290368 Surikaten.: Sounds like a good idea. We'll write it down to be looked in to for the next update
1390287630 TheCanadianFluffy: Very interesting and does sound like alot of work. But how would I know? :P
1390273506 Frios10: @Hotline_101, ah I see. Well I think it would be a good feature in the future 
1390251262 Hotline_101: @Frios10, you wouldn't know that you had been ignored, if you were ignored, you could still comment to them, but they wouldn't see the comment or get a notification 
1390246441 Frios10: @Hotline_101, I think somthing like this would be cool but lets not go so fast we just got this update not even a week ago and we are already talking about new features
1390246379 Frios10: @Hotline_101, hmm on the otherwise we would have those certain people report that they have been "ignored" for no reason. Like the people who constantly report that they have been block for no reason. 
1390244269 Hotline_101: Input everyone?
