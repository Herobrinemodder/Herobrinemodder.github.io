I thought of an interesting (And useful) tool for everyone to use that would help this app with rude users dissing uploaders and people viewing a seed or post, a way to "Ignore" users from an upload, like blocking, except a person's comment who you've ignored will cease to appear, and notifications that they have sent you as a popup message won't show, you could do it like blocking, in which case, you can take someone off this list too, it would help when having issues with a flamer or bully on a seed who's uploader is inactive. Also, it would improve moderating, as half of the reports I get are because people have no way to block someone if it isn't their seed, also, an ignore would only apply to the person who ignored another user, everyone else would still be able to see a comment unless they ignore the said person, secondly, if you want, moderator comments can be "ignored", excluding warnings, which will always appear. Input Surikaten or MCSeeds?</p><img src=Feature_Idea_for_Seeds_Pro_6_01.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
