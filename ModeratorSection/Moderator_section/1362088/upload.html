As you might have noticed, the new 7.0.0 update is now finally out and available on the App Store! In it we included a slew of new moderator features to make things a tad bit easier - listing them all here below!
1. Linked account names can now quickly be reported & instantly reset by tapping on the linked account names, then tapping the exclamation mark to the right of it. Do note however that this only applies to inappropriate names. Irrelevant names are still allowed as verifying those would mean having to jump into every console and double check them all manually, which would quickly become a hassle and not worth the trouble. Irrelevant names don't harm anyone anyway except the users followers as they wont be able to search them up and play with them. So irrelevant names are still OK like they've always been, but inappropriate ones can now quickly be reported and cleared.
2. Flag content notes! Now when flagging something you can choose to also add a quick note to follow with the flag, for much easier reference in the future when browsing said items. The choice to add notes will be given when you flag something :-)
3. Ability to convert seed id's to their number equivalent. This only works for seeds that aren't 100% numeric. If an upload appears to have a bad/inappropriate word in it, no need to fire a warning to the uploader or anything (Unless the uploader is continuously doing it), but tap the Mod button in the top right corner > Upload options > Convert seed and the seed will be converted to its number equivalent. Note that a convert might take a few minutes to appear in the app due to the app cache. However converting the same seed multiple times has no effect and will only convert it once, so no worries about accidentally converting a seed someone else already has converted :-)
4. Report profile pictures. If an Inappropriate / Offensive profile picture happens to make its way into the app, they can swiftly be reported by tapping on them and tapping Report.
Believe those are all the new features! If we missed something and you happen to notice something new don't hesitate to fire a comment here and remind us :-) A lot of new features were added we forgot to fully keep track of the exclusive ones.
And again if a bug or glitch somehow appears in any of these features, or any other feature for that matter, don't hesitate to shoot a comment or an email and we'll check it out ASAP and see what's going on.
Edit: Also there appears to have been a bug with upload process when posting anything other than Seeds. This has now been fixed however and a clean restart of the app should fix it. Luckily the Draft feature was added in this update saving any progress made to the uploads :-)
Best!! :)
