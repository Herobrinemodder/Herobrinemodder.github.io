<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Equinox</h2><p>TG has a post about him.  He's on a rampage.  I've dealt with him before.  I have to look at my email history to see if I emailed JN about his bio as I don't recall.   Just checked, I emailed them on July 31.  I did a mod post about him.  Do a look up if you wish to see it.
The third image is a convo on one of my posts.

Just looked at my mod post from a few months ago.  He says in the convo with another user that he's really a user called Epicreations.

Don't know if that's true though.</p><img src=EQUINOX11.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=EQUINOX12.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=EQUINOX13.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
