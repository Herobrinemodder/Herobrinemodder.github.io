1412777053 Surikaten.: @bubblybabs, yeah that would be swiftest, as long as they aren't completely inappropriate otherwise report :-)
1412777001 bubblybabs: @Surikaten., ok, thanks. Shall do that now. What about her having the screenshot up on the other boards? They weren't in her private section. Move them to private?
1412774530 Surikaten.: @bubblybabs, ah sorry my bad! :-) Sure you can delete it as the comment was pretty old and archived and nothing much has changed in it for a long time, so a screencap of it is as great evidence as any :-)
1412774029 bubblybabs: @Surikaten., I meant, should I have deleted the sexual comment after I took the screenshot? I didn't know if that was something you all wanted to see in person or not.
1412773976 Surikaten.: To show her followers how he/she looks etc - similar to what people post on Instagram. And the fact that it was posted to Private keeps it in the appropriate section so it's not on the public boards and if someone doesn't agree with her non-board related post they can just unfollow her and they wont see her uploads anymore :-)
1412773885 Surikaten.: Selfies and images of oneself are allowed as long as they are posted to private - since the private section is intended for direct communication between a user and their followers to discuss anything between heaven and earth, and if someone doesn't like what a user posts to Private they can just unfollow that user and they wont see their posts any more. As for the selfie post of that user, I don't think it should be removed as I don't think it's inappropriate but just a selfie post by that user
1412769835 bubblybabs: Bump
1412762898 bubblybabs: Also, this girl has placed this image up in 2 public boards asking for help. Do I move them or leave them where they are?

Also, didn't know if I should delete the original comment or not- I took the snapshot and all but didn't know if you guys needed to see the original or not.

Going by TG's helpful info upload, I guess I should. Please advise.
