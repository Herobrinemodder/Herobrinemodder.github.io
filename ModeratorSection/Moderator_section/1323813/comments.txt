1414716582 bubblybabs: @falkirknh, sounds good to me. I agree with their views but they should have worded it in a less caustic way.
1414716458 falkirknh: Thanks for moving it, I deleted it as it was continuing to be the site of fights.
1414716361 bubblybabs: I moved it to private stating that it will probably be deleted and why. That gives the uploader a chance to read why their upload might be deleted so they hopefully don't make the same mistake again. And it allows @falkirknh the chance to delete it as they wish.

Hope that's ok. I still think religious and political views should only go in the private sector of the app anyway.
1414714458 bubblybabs: If religious views are allowed and opposite s*x love views are allowed and that willow person views are allowed, then this should be allowed as well.

Addendum: I have to agree with what @falkirknh said in the posts comment area. If they had just worded this better in the description box it wouldn't be such an issue.
1414695674 Hotline_101: Funny thing is, 'Homophobia'
means 'fear of the same' when you translate it from Latin :P
1414694655 Hotline_101: It's only going to invite little kiddies from both sides who think they know so much about the issue to fight uselessly over it, I would have to agree.
