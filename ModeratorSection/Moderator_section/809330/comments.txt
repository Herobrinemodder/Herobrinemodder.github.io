1382446192 Surikaten.: He doesn't seem to be the same as the original MexicanKidd - but he has several accounts with that name nonetheless, perma banned.
1382298001 Hotline_101: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf, I saw, she won't give up, now she appears to be pretending that her friend did it, I'm gonna ask Surikaten if they can track down what her other account is, she's gone this far with a secret account, we can assume she might do the same on her "Real" account.

1382285289 Frios10: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf, u weren't there
1382285258 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, delete his comments? he never did 
1382284406 Frios10: If he is using an older version how did he delete his comments?
1382284386 Frios10: How does he download the app if he deletes it? Is it from itunes or the App Store? Because if we can somehow get him to delete and redownload of the App Store it will be the version we have right now and we could ban him right? But if he downloads from itunes he will keep getting the old version. I have one question though. 
1382284250 Frios10: @AndrewDill, Surikaten is right if we do that it will ruin it for those who can't update but want to use the app
1382276314 Hotline_101: @AndrewDill, True, from my experience, Mexxican is a bit of an idiot, I doubt he's a programmer 
1382275990 Surikaten.: @AndrewDill, we thought about doing that but the thing is we want to keep the app backwards compatible, for users who can't update the app due to various reasons. It would be unfair to cut the app off for those users. I'll have a look again and see if he has updated his ap

1382247687 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @AndrewDill, okay
1382247597 AndrewDill: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf,Ok.But if you can't then we can always get JN to do the server data update thing that I mentioned below.That would leave him with no choice.
1382247452 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @AndrewDill, ill get him to update one way or another
1382247404 AndrewDill: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf,Updating to IOS 7 doesn't update applications.He needs to update the seeds pro application in order for us to be able to IP ban him.
1382247265 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @AndrewDill, well heres the thing if he has ios 7 it shouldve updated automatically
1382247232 AndrewDill: We could get JN to make a new kind of data output from their servers and an update that recognizes it.That way the old updates will no longer be compatible with the data coming from JN's servers and will cease to work.Then he'll have to either update or do some hardcore reprogramming to get back on,and I doubt he's a programmer.
1382238396 Hotline_101: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf, Make sure the username is NOT discoverable by Mexxican

1382238020 Hotline_101: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf, I think the best thing to say would be

"hey Mexxican, in the new update, theres a bug that people can't be banned"
