1376953200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, Thanks for warning us.

Get it? :P
I've never received a warning before, and it quite shocked me.
1376953200 Bob Ross: IM GOING TO SPAM THIS THREAD TO GET IT TO THE TOP SO JN CAN SEE THAT WE NEED NEW MOD TOOLS
1375052400 Frios10: @#Herobrine#, yea
1375052400 Bob Ross: @Frios10, too complicated PMs. XD
1374966000 Frios10: I have an idea but for PM what if we made it to where we could sort the PMs into categories so we could have a category of people we PM and people we don't PM. It would help because if you have to many PM sessions right now it lags but if we had this we could have a lot of PM sessions but it wouldn't lag. 
1374966000 falkirknh: Also I think the ability to place a lock on commenting on an upload would help us deal with huge comment wars. It could automatically unlock after 24 hours or when another mod saw fit.
1373929200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, I reckon you should. No one checks the current news section, so you can write about things in there. 
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, one that has '3.1.1, coming soon!,
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, should I start like a news thread that has news about Minecraft Seeds Pro?
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, heheh. 

I'm like the junior news reporter?

Yeah I talk with Nahir. 3.1.1, coming soon :D
1373929200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, "Surikaten says that they are working on the 3.1.1" - #Herobrine#, 2013

Getting used to knowing this sort of stuff
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, used to what?
1373929200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, I'm still getting used to that
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, well for sure they are implementing new tools for mods...Surikaten says that they are working on the 3.1.1 update.
1373842800 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, hmm...
1373842800 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, ok.

It seems to me that we are being selfish. Has anyone thought of a feature to directly benefit normal users?
1373756400 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, well I will make one then.
1373756400 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, Yeah... 

It sounds like Hotline mailed the company about this, but I don't know for sure
1373756400 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, or probably just Nahir...
1373756400 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, I hope that Jean and Nahir see this :-)
1373670000 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, tickets, they are pretty much comments that we delete after we've resolved the problem 
1373670000 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, hmmm I don't want to make the company work too much for that...since XCODE is hard to program. 

I think a simpler way would be better.

Are tickets just comments, or are they a new special feature you are requesting?
1373583600 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Interesting idea as I said in PM
1373583600 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, hmmm... We already have that in form of the burnt wooden board. Somewhere where users can comment would be great, a hub for reporting to finally clear the app of report threads that get bogged down.

Users could send in a ticket, which would be visible to all mods and users who view the hub. Once a mod sorts it out they delete the ticket.

I suppose trusted helpers could be added too
1373497200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, ah I was thinking if a NEW section in the app that was called 'Report Abuse' and only moderators could post there...but I guess that's a little too pushy.
1373497200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, it'll be just like a report abuse thread where users can comment about Shizzlewizzle that has happened. Pretty much a report thread, but sticky.
1373497200 Bob Ross: Yes that will be extremely helpful and easily accessed...but I want that ONLY moderators can publish them...not regular users...or else the Report Abuse section will be spammed up. 

I think it is a very good idea. I see know why they appointed you so soon :-)
