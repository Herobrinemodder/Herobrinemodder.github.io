<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Suggestion</h2><p>Just a quick suggestion today,
Moderator warnings should stay 'stickied' at the top of the upload's comment section for easy viewing.
This would only apply to warnings left to the uploader. Warnings to users (eg. @Hellomynameis99_) will not be stickied.
Discuss! :-)</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/01-14/Suggestion1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
