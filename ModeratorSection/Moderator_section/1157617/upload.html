<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Gamec0cks$$$ Fight #2</h2><p>Hey mods! Not sure if you remember this guy but he was in a fight a while back. The situation which I forgot to take pictures of, Sorry about that. Anyways here is the story. Black Death had a meme saying call a girl pretty a million times and they will never believe you but call them ugly once and they will never forget it. So a girl said what she would do and then Game decided to say "your ugly" to test it out. The girl then said that she didnt care over the internet and Game said something offensive and the girl flipped. Game then said he was kidding.
I told game to stop and he got mad. This is his second fight. Maybe a warning sent from Surikaten?</p><img src=Gamec0cks_Fight_21.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=Gamec0cks_Fight_22.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
