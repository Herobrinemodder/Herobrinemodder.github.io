1375830000 Surikaten.: Fixed :-) Sorry bout that, was caused by a small server glitch
1375743600 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, yea 
1375743600 Hellomynameis99: Well, until it's fixed, everyone can enjoy being number 7 :-)
1375743600 falkirknh: Same here it must be a server glitch. Should be fixed or fix itself when the server updates.
