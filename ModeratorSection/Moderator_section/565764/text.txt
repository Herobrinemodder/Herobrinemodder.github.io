Hey guys,

as we wrote in falkirknhs latest mod thread, due to a minor glitch that occured in the server a few days ago some uploads have either turned invisible or lost their 'Featured' status. We are working on restoring them all to their previous state asap, but the biggest problem is we don't know what uploads were affected. So if you know of any upload, or have any upload that has been affected don't hesitate to either make a comment/thread here in the mod board or email in to us and we'll try restore it ASAP.

Sorry for the trouble! We'll try fix this as fast as possible :-)
