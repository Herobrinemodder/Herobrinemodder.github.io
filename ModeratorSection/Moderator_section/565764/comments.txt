1377039600 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, Well, no, but the threads on the board are scanned every now and then :-)
1376953200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, AHA HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT??? ARE YOU ACTUALLY ANOTHER ACCOUNT OF THEM???
1374188400 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, :D

       OIL
1374015600 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, They do skim over the comments here every now and then, but yeah, not like us :-)

Anyway, money is made of...
Paper.
Paper is made of...
Wood.
Wood comes from...
Trees.

(Depends where you live though. Our money is made of oil :-)
1373929200 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, ok
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, who is? The company has better stuff to do than view our comments...money isn't grown on trees (sadly.)

Are you referring to Hotline and AndrewDill?
1373929200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, :-)
1373929200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, yes, and they are probably reading this right now.
1373929200 Bob Ross: Please.
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, you too.
1373929200 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yes Surikaten is Nahir Can, the younger brother of Jean, and Jean is the founder of JN. Nahir is in charge of developing this app.

DONT TELL ANYONE PLEASE HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL AFTER I REVEALED HIM.
1373929200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, Herobrine Spam :D
1373929200 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, Surikaten 
1373842800 Bob Ross: @Minecraft Seeds, falk would say thanks for fixing his upload if he were here.
1373842800 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, heheh I know who Nahir is...he is a moderator. I can't tell you because he doesn't want me telling.
1373842800 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, Probably Jean
1373842800 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, Yay!
1373842800 Bob Ross: Or not.
1373842800 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, I wonder who Minecraft Seeds is. Probably someone from the company.
1373842800 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, Jean is the founder of JNInteractive and Nahir is his younger brother that is the lead developer of this app.
1373842800 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, yay Surikaten. is Nahir!!!!

YAY
1373238000 Minecraft Seeds: @AndrewDill, Bug! Fixed :-)
1373238000 AndrewDill: My seed
-6390107926604469963
was featured at one time but lost its featured status a long time ago.I'm not shure if it was lost due to the bug or simply due to bad ratings or popularity.
1373065200 Minecraft Seeds: @#Herobrine#, we'll try provide a choice to warn the uploader or a user in the next update
1373065200 Bob Ross: @Minecraft Seeds, yes that is a very good idea...but me and Hellomyname have been thinking up another feature. Why not implement warning comments that work TOWARDS USERS (Not the uploader of the thread.)?
1372892400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hellomynameis99_, Hmm yeah that sounds like a useful feature. We'll be looking at improving all the mod tools soon in an upcoming update, will try squeeze that feature in then :-)
1372892400 Hellomynameis99: @Minecraft Seeds, that would be a great idea. 

On a different topic, you would have seen my User Watchlist thread. Could we have a similar feature in the mod board where one can simply "add a user" to a "Watchlistâ„¢". Then any user who has been added can be tapped to view a brief description of previous offenses and a link to their profile? That would be great and I believe it would help a lot.
1372892400 Minecraft Seeds: @Hellomynameis99_, awesome, thanks a lot :-) Should probably place the news section somewhere more visible to make these things more accessible.
1372892400 Hellomynameis99: I just saw the news upload concerning this, and I've uploaded a public thread (knowing many users don't even know the news section exists). I've also given them details to contact you if their thread has been affected.
