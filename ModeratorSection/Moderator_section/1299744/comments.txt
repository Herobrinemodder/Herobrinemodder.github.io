1412192351 Bob Ross: Gigi is a bit mean...he was involved in the 5 year old rage problem by provoking him...and he has been criticizing people, which is not against the rules, but he does so in a way to provoke the user he is targeting,
1412182549 Hellomynameis99: Looks like he answered his own question!! :-P

If he's still following you, you can restart the PM by tapping his avatar and then the envelope in the top right corner.
1412176378 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, I think he either unfollowed and then refollowed you, or as Frios said, deleted the session and started it up later.
1412173500 bubblybabs: Interesting. Ok, now I know what it looks like when that's done. Thanks 
1412173346 Frios10: He deleted the pm session
