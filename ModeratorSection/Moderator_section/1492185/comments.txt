1429923261 Bob Ross: Yes he is joking

Also, the 2 day thing is because if you change your name or user tag, then you will have to wait 48 hrs to change it again.

It wasn't a "dare," probably he was joking around with names but then it kept the name for 2 days and he was too embarrassed to admit that he made that mistake
