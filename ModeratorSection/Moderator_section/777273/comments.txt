1380420698 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I didn't, I don't get notifications cause of IOS 7
1380420660 Frios10: @Hotline_101, •~•
1380420541 Frios10: @Hotline_101, and you didn't respond to my PMs *~* <-- that bes a face that's disappointed I am going to make that a thing
1380420326 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Only visible to mods btw 
1380420315 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, JN, could you add a user flagging feature? If a user is cussing and or breaking rules, we can press a button which has (For example) A blue "Flagged" label next to the name, so it'd be easier to keep an eye on people 
1380419951 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, ok :)
1380419214 Minecraft Seeds: @Frios10, currently n/a, it's still in the works - but once it's fully charged and loaded we'll submit it to Apple for review asap. :-)
1380418728 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, I think I said that wrong I was saying when the update would come?
1380418696 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Minecraft Seeds, frios is having a nice conversation with u lol
1380418665 Minecraft Seeds: @Frios10, it will still cost - it will just be better incorporated. :-)
1380418591 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, I wanted to know also when the next update for this app would be?
1380418566 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, yup
1380418506 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, lol ur having a nice conversation with Minecraft Seeds
1380418454 Minecraft Seeds: @Frios10, Servers Pro is more of a bi-product of the entire Seeds community. We'll be looking more into incorporating it better into Seeds Pro in upcoming updates so the need to switch between the apps, hopefully, becomes seamless.

Edit: That's still a bit far ahead though, so Servers Pro might receive a few refined updates until then. But the end result will hopefully be two seamless apps.
1380418387 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, ok. I was wondering are you guys planing on adding any new feature to that app like sections and stuff? 
1380418336 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, true i have it
1380418309 Minecraft Seeds: @Frios10, Minecraft Servers is our app, yes :-) As for an account on Seeds Pro, no, this is our only official account. All others who lack the (Admin) label aren't us. :-)
1380418220 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, well I know it can be made into a great app like this one with a few new features if they try
1380418174 Minecraft Seeds: …if it continues and we'll take further actions. Sorry for the long reply :-)
1380418172 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Minecraft Seeds, it does alot thnxz
1380418159 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, lol ur all into that app arent u
1380418138 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, so are u and Minecraft Servers! The same people?
1380418137 Minecraft Seeds: …built in tools (such as blocking a user) to prevent that user from interacting with their uploads again. This goes for other "mildly profane" words as well. If they are really profane or offensive - delete the comment. If it gets excessive, warn and or report.

Hope this clears up that email a bit more :-) As for that specific case that you reported, we warned both users and do let us know…
1380418085 Frios10: @Minecraft Seeds, the...what?
1380418012 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, i have servers pro its okay
1380417982 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @#Herobrine#, i am lol
1380417967 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Minecraft Seeds, ahhh okay. thnxz that makes much more sense
1380417946 Minecraft Seeds: Hey Bolt, sorry for the slow response :-) What we meant was just in a general sense. If someone posts a comment containing a just "mildly offensive" word (eg. This upload 'sucks') - don't warn that user. Don't even delete that comment for that matter as the comment isn't violating any rules, "sucks" isn't a profane word.

And if the uploader feels offended by that comment they can use the…
1380413607 Frios10: @Hotline_101, u should get it
1380413579 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yah, I've heard of it
1380411419 Frios10: @Hotline_101, I got it it's like a smaller version of this. I think they could do more with it though.
1380411388 Frios10: @Hotline_101, u should get servers pro
1380411377 Frios10: @#Herobrine#, dude I found u on servers pro 0_0
1380407750 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, Lol
1380406071 Bob Ross: Then Falk made me feel bad by saying that so I became better :-)
1380406045 Bob Ross: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, I think You're paranoid...
1380399766 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, okay cuz i reported that user and this was the reply i got confused
1380399476 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, and they weren't talking about that specific user
1380399456 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, ok
1380399439 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, i just did srry im out dress shopping for my 9th grade dance 
1380399406 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Minecraft Seeds what exactly did u guys mean by this? cwop123 was cussinng alot 
1380399404 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, I meant in the comments but ok
1380398828 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, tag them
1380398764 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, kk
1380398713 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, no they mean overall. Listen I think you need to sit down for a minute and listen to what Minecraft seeds and Surtikan say to u about how to moderate just to be sure. 
1380398616 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, it wasnt just one though. did u see the post?
1380398541 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, no in the comments but I already did. What they mean is if a user simply says one cuss or something on a thread don't warn them just delete the comment. And if they keep doing it that's when u warn them. Then if they keep doing it that's when u post it on the mod board. See?
1380398431 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, in the description?
1380398394 Frios10: Well why don't u tag them and ask like this
