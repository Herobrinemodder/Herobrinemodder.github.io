<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>I think all religious posts</h2><p>I think all religious posts should be deleted if my atheist post gets deleted.  I'm taking a stance on this.  The religious ones complain about atheist and agnostic posts but cry oppression if their's are deleted.  If atheist and agnostic posts get deleted then every single religious post should get deleted.</p><img src=I_think_all_religious_posts1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
