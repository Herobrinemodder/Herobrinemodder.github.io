I was weird how everything disappeared for a while. Maybe it was my internet?
Anyway, I was just saying that if my Atheist post that was carefully worded so it wasn't offensive gets deleted then all religious posts need to be deleted.
1415068005 Frios10: @bubblybabs, there's a simple solution. Ask Suritaken to see who deleted it and then he has a talk with them. I'm not sure if your thread should have been removed or not I never saw it.

Wanted to thank you for sticking up for my post. I know I put you all in a sticky position. It's amazing how quickly an Atheist post will get reported in hopes it'll get deleted but there's Christian ones everywhere. I made sure I worded my description box as unoffensively as I could.

1414983341 bubblybabs: For a while there, anything I typed in disappeared.
1414982947 bubblybabs: Are my comments being restricted?
1414979398 Hotline_101: I wonder who deleted it... 

Anyway, I almost am tempted to agree, religious posts cause more harm than good
