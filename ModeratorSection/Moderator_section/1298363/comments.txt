1412030812 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, You can always add Surikaten. to the list. If he's been inactive you know that he's working on solving a technological riddle or on a well-deserved holiday.

1412024773 Hotline_101: So, Surikaten, Telepathic, Bubblybabs, Wolf, Pyk, probably Frios and SF, other then that, not a lot of us are really active these days.
1412017234 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, Other then the rules which apply to everyone, moderator or not, no, not really, you could ask Surikaten., he would know if there's any real guidelines. :)

Gtg
1412017067 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, is there a specific place with moderator guidelines?
1412016981 Hotline_101: @bubblybabs, If you want I can get you up to speed on any moderator features that you aren't sure about yet, I think you left before I was even a moderator :P

That's been nearly a year now.
1412016920 bubblybabs: @Hotline_101, thank you my dear.

1412016047 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, I do follow wolf
1412016025 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, You don't follow all the actives like Wolfdata, therefor, I can never add you :/
1412015982 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, active, but I never get invited to the mod PMs anyways.
