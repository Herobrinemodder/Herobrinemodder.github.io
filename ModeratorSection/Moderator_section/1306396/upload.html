<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Stealing a seed</h2><p>Keep seeing this.
Someone uploads an epic seed using words, then someone else uploads it later with the seed ID in numerical form.
Would recommend app be made so only numbers be used as seed ID
And
How do you handle this?  Do you delete or let it go?  Do you make a comment?  Just want to know so I know what to do in the future.
