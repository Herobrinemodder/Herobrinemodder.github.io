1405649118 Frios10: @Surikaten., yea I was going to update this thread, he said he wanted to stop like yesterday. 
1405638985 Surikaten.: Feels like high-time for a ban, he doesn't seem to adhere to any warnings. Will fire him on a temporary ban asap, hopefully that eases it down a bit :-)

Edit: after fiurther digging in to it we decided to just fire the user a warning - hopefully that eases him down a bit
1405628528 Bob Ross: Called me a loner moderator and the sad, outcast one (which I kind of am and don't care) but then quickly turned around and called another user a f@ggot
1405476745 TheCanadianFluffy: Wow he is quite descriptive. I say ban.
1405439024 Hotline_101: Wow... Heartless kid :P
