<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>MODERATORS! </h2><p>Im tired of everyone ignoring this user, he has made way to much trouble on here, most of his posts are anti christian or jokes about christians
He keeps being so offending to any beleif but his own, he made a few direct hate threads to christians and they got deleted, but now this has gone to far, im tired of y'all ignoring this and saying its just a joke because its obviously racist.
Now look, if i posted a thread racist to black people, would it get deleted? Yes, but most of seeds is anti religion from what i've experienced, either this place changes or im gone, im not gunna be a part of a place where everyone is anti religion and such.
Hate- ive been getting allot of hate from users that hate religion, then tey say "LOL" on christian hate posts, if this doesn't stop i stop.
-_- this is not a hate thread, this is a thread to mods i hope it gets moved to moderator section before i get a bunch of hate.</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/09-13/MODERATORS_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
