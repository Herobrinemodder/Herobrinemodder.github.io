<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>PM Session</h2><p>Hey friends!
The update is out and we have no excuse not to follow each other.
Full lists of moderators are available on multiple threads on this board. So it's time to hunt down those users and tap follow!
A PM session will be set up later in the week, or after new moderators are appointed. 
Don't forget that you can disable notifications per session using the button on the top right of the interface.
I'll look forward to the conversations we have! :-)</p><img src=PM_Session1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
