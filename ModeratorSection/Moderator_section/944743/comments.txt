1389983563 Bob Ross: XD I don't follow staff since they are inactive
1389978674 falkirknh: If I haven't followed anyone please tag me and we can fix that :-)

1389978594 falkirknh: @Hellomynameis99_, NEVER contradict hitchhikers :P
1389977144 TheCanadianFluffy: I followed everyone I could find. I heard there are a few sessions going around and Im none :p
1389976574 TheCanadianFluffy: Im finding the other staff now!
1389974790 Hotline_101: Yep, gonna make sure I followed the other JN staff :)
1389954057 Hellomynameis99: @Pykirknh, HueHueHue :-)
1389954034 Hellomynameis99: @Pykirknh, Interesting though that sounds, I was thinking we should theorize over the meaning of life, the universe and everything else. I think that the 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' may have got it wrong...
1389953871 Bob Ross: Ah yes, I crave for some intellectual activities!

Shall we read together the Official 2010 Science book, or do some recreational mathematics? 

Diophantine Geometry, anyone?
