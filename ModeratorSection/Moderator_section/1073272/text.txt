Hey!
Just a little upload to break the silence that has fallen over the least-used section of the app.
And now it's time for the news!
Some new features coming in the next update...
• A new feature that allows users to 'ignore' someone else. This means that minor issues (that don't necessarily break any rules) can be overlooked by moderators - simply refer the user to the 'ignore' feature.
• A notification section where you will be able to view all your recent notifications - no more pulling your hair out over choosing "Bob replied to your comment on your upload Hi" or "Bob has commented 'Come back..' on your upload Bye".
Aaaand that's about it.
Thanks for watching!
