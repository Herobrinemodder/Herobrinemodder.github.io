1386954217 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Oh, ok
1386951639 Hellomynameis99: I forgot to mention that the code that handles upload bumping (Bringing an upload up to the top of the forum list) has also been changed to bring more relevant and generally awesome content to the top, which should help filter unnecessary uploads such as chat rooms. The new update should also bring group PMs. That's all I know about it as of yet. :-) 
1386951132 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Nope, just passing on information :-)
1386948863 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, hmmmm, you working for JNInteractive there Hello?
1386922215 Hellomynameis99: Oh, and one last thing to add to this thread.

Look at these one star reviews of the app. Then look at the average rating: 4.5 out of 5. If that's not something to be proud of, I don't know what is...

Get back to work! :-)
1386922108 Hellomynameis99: Next major update coming this month... Certain forum overhauls, such as the one suggested on another thread, are being implemented...
1386861887 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, They were, well, at the time, we didn't care much
1386842973 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, They were.

And they will be again.

:-)
1384754393 kathryncrusher: @Hotline_101, I sadly barley saw the actual days of Minecraft seeds on here. Must of been good times
1384486956 Hotline_101: @falkirknh, haven't seen you in a while Falk, how are you doing?
1384486922 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, It's sad really... This app was actually related to Seeds once.... I remember those days
1384482639 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, I totally agree...this is know as Minecraft Twitter now.
1384062856 falkirknh: But I think I got my point accross
1384062846 falkirknh: I would say more but I have to go, sorry
1384062829 falkirknh: the community dynamic we used to have. It seems that we have just added a lot of places for abuse to occur without the means of prevention. We couldn't foresee the amount of abuse that would occur as the previous content based system didn't leave room for it. As for the top 25, I think that all of them have earned there place there. I remember hauling out 20 seeds a day to get followers :P


1384062695 falkirknh: either. I think the app started down hill as soon as forums were added. Now, that is a personal opinion as I loved the content based non competitive systems to have. It seems that we decided or quickly change the focus of our community and people, weren't entirely ready and neither was our abuse handling infrastructure. I think that the further updating of the app will allow us to return to... 
1384062494 falkirknh: Forgive my late and long comment, but I think it is important I voice my thoughts. I fully support Hotline in the fact the app has taken a downward turn. I don't agree with pointing at moderators though, we have a lot of work to do but we work in a sandbox just like normal users, we can't blame these issues on ourselves as we are just doing our job. That being said, it isn't really JN's fault...
1383862749 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hotline_101,more people want more. i think they want it just becuz it makes them look cool and they get more followers that way. 
1383852026 Hotline_101: @Minecraft Seeds, Kk :)
1383838496 Hotline_101: @AndrewDill, Yah, I like the 2nd idea, but I think there NEEDS to be the removal of some of this stuff
1383838431 Hotline_101: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~Ꮭεgεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡอโf, You forget that you aren't the only active mod, but yes, I personally just wonder if more people want mods or a lack of mods
1383836287 Frios10: @AndrewDill, a flagging power would be abused by many users...I'm not sure it's a great idea. Maybe we should look in to that report center for all of us to look at rather then report abuse threads
1383812982 AndrewDill: \/ As for comments JN needs to improve the language blocker.With the bullying we are just going to have to really encourage users to block"bullies."What(I personally think)matters most on an app called SEEDS PRO is the SEEDS,not the forums.We possibly should encourage users to focus more on the seeds than forums.In seeds comments bulling happens less and we can stop it easily.
1383812585 AndrewDill: We're going to have to keep the fourms or we'll get a lot of people mad at us.We will have to handle the forums in a different way though.There should be a"Flag inapropriate thread"setting for users so that they can flag threads.The flagged threads would appear in a list for moderators who could efficiently go through them and decide if they are inapropriate or not(This is how YouTube flags work)
1383807862 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: hey! becuz of me (well i think it was me) this app has calmed down alot. I say we keep mods but i agree with the top 25. Im going to miss it but o well
1383769656 Hotline_101: @Mad Man T1zer 53, yah, I've been relatively busy too
1383769534 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, ok:3 by the way sorry I haven't been active for long, I go on Clash Of Clans a lot, and Im in Year 6 at school now, the oldest of Junior School, so I've go lots of work to do.
1383769470 Hotline_101: @Mad Man T1zer 53, It already has :3
I just copy-pasted it and placed another in forums, 
1383769321 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, didn't see that message lol
1383769285 Mad Man T1zer 53: I vote to keep mods, by the way this won't go to the users as it's on the mod board XD
1383769207 Hotline_101: Btw, I'm posting this on Forums too, hence the section about users and Top25ers
