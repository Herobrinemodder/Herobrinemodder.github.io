Hello,

Lately I have seen this user impersonate people...first Minecraft Seeds, then falkirknh. People are falling for it, and he keeps changing his name.

Should I let him be? His name right now is Falkirknh. Hellomyname has encountered him and done nothing...so I don't know what to do. I don't have a pic of him right now.
