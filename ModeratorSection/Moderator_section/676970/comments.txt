1377212400 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, IKR :-)
1376607600 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., haha :-)
1376607600 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, i got the same disease.. Just have to include one at the end of each message :-)
1376607600 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., sounds good :-)

It shouldn't be too much of a problem, it's easy to re-navigate to an upload once gamecentre loads. :-)

Sometimes I feel like I use smileys too often... But you don't want someone to read your comment the wrong way. :/
Smilies show expression :-)

(4 smilies in that text. Now 5 :-)
1376607600 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, @#Herobrine#, that's because the app page is loading while the app hasn't yet logged in to gamecenter, so the app doesn't know if you're a mod or not yet. But will try and fix that asap for the next update :-)
1376607600 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., what Hellomynameis99_ said...happens to me too.
1376521200 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., for me it happens when tapping notification to get to an upload. I usually navigate to uploads by favoriting them or searching, as I find it works that way.
1376521200 Surikaten.: @Hotline_101, uhh hmm that can't be?? Tried restarting the app? Does it happen on a specific upload or on all?
1376521200 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., Ive found a bug, my Mod button has vanished o_O
1376434800 Surikaten.: Could fire him a warning :-) What's his current name?
1376348400 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, I don't care about RPX, he's a troller, as long as he doesn't start claiming to be a mod
1376262000 falkirknh: Nasty person :-)
1376262000 Hellomynameis99: I told Hotline about him when he was impersonating him... He was fine with it, and the user's name is RPX. RPX says that Belly told him to do it, which I doubt...

So yeah, I haven't been idle :-)
1376175600 Frios10: But he is belly at the moment if you want to see him go to my report abuse thread
1376175600 Frios10: His name was belly last I saw him...then he changed it to Frios10
