1402838516 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., I couldn't tell from the existing comments, there were some missing, which was odd....
1402823725 Surikaten.: Edit: Just doublechecked and it seems like he was just standing up for a kid in the comments posted and not meant to be ill-intended or orchestrate a fight? Could keep an eye on this user just in case it escalates.

As for the title malfunction, bug! Will fix ASAP :-) For some reason it's the profanity detector spooking about converting seed ids to numbers for mod and forum threads as well. Should only apply to Seeds - will be corrected asap :-)
1402802195 Hellomynameis99: I got the same report you did, concerning this user...
1402759609 Frios10: Well I surely don't remember telling blaze to delete all of his threads 
1402757109 TheCanadianFluffy: Well if he was banned and is back bullying then he clearly hasnt learned. I say ban.
1402751110 Hotline_101: Hmmm... Title malfunctioned
