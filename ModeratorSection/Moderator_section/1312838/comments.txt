1413722141 Minecraft Seeds: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, @Pykirknh, great! A warning has been dispatched. He is on his final warning now, if he STILL doesn’t ease down with his inappropriate comments and remarks please bump and a ban will be due as soon as possible :-)

1413561294 Minecraft Seeds: Next time he/she updates his linked accounts with something profane please don’t hesitate to bump this thread and we will fire a warning ASAP.

As for rude behavior, that is not against the rules and he did upload the post to Private so if anyone doesn’t appreciate his rude behavior they can just unfollow him and they wont see his posts anymore. However if he uploads them to the public sections don’t hesitate to bump and we will fire him the warning asap.

1413505030 Hotline_101: Amen, he should at least get a warning from JN, if not a temp ban if he goes on like This.
1413504996 DimplesCS: Yes I highly agree! He has been a problem with his behavior and he has received to many warnings!
