1404463031 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, I like to use the phrase 'users expectations' to demonstrate the issues with that: The system might flag it as 's ex'
1404418417 Bob Ross: @TheCanadianFluffy, yeah that's why I called it an abuse of the space cuss since it can't be fixed
1404418377 TheCanadianFluffy: @Pykirknh, Oh. Well thats not good.
1404418341 Bob Ross: @TheCanadianFluffy, has already been reported to Surikaten., they can't fix it due to the filter thinking that anything with a letter that is in a cuss word is profanity
1404418290 TheCanadianFluffy: @Pykirknh, That will need to be fixed.
1404418272 Bob Ross: C UNT

1404380847 Surikaten.: Will fire him an official warning and see if that has any effect. If it continues can take further measures from there.
1404374338 Hellomynameis99: Wow, why does he find it necessary to say "What is a moderator? Fu ck"? 

I mean, what does 'fu ck' have to do with his question?
