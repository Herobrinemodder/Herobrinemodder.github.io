1387665065 Hellomynameis99: AB plays removed the GC tag from his/her username as I watched... It was fascinating! :-)
1387631169 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Nope, appears Kkiras was part of it
1387605341 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, So, Kkiras was involved? I just thought he/she was jumping on the bandwagon... 
1387605008 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Actually... All three have been banned
(AB, The other "GC Mod", and Bloo, aperantly, our suspicions were right
1387604823 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Nvm, AB has been banned :P
1387604672 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, He was one too, that is... He seems to be mighty coincidental 
1387604640 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Indeed
1387601303 Bob Ross: Heheheh Steve thinks Teague is a babe XD
1387600913 Hellomynameis99: What will happen to AB? It may be an alternate account, but it was still him using the inappropriate language and such...
1387600688 Hellomynameis99: Kkrias is now a "GC mod"
1387600220 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Just saw your comment on the "WARNING! STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT LEFAR" thread... 
1387600139 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, just removed all references or comments from or to myself in this account on the old account :)
1387599757 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Anyway, I plan to try it out sooner or later 
1387599739 Hotline_101: Accidentally put my home address XD
Autocorrect
1387599570 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, I'd live to see his reaction! :-)
1387599443 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, I get an interesting feeling he will say no, or maybe nothing 
1387599421 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, That's what I'm thinking, I'm debating on telling him to ban my old account
"Arvo K"
Because Arvo K "Cussed and bullied a lot"
1387599145 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, I've been thinking the same thing. The Bloo user could be either a friend's or an alt account of his. It's the only logical way that he got the "GC BANNED" tag on it.
1387598974 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Yah, I suspect it's AB, he's been going around doing this scam about being a Gamecenter moderator
1387598831 Hellomynameis99: I just found Bloo asking Bolt if she "wanna (pic 2)". Naturally, I deleted the comment...
1387597527 Hellomynameis99: I've encountered The Zap bloo Ta 4 on that thread "FUNNY STEVE"... His language was rather worse than it is here...
1387587477 kathryncrusher: Well... For sure warning for the steve guy. I know very little about Bloo Taboo though.
1387586971 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yah... That's what I thought too XD
1387578209 Frios10: Dang....I wonder if the Steve guy knows Teague is a boy XD
