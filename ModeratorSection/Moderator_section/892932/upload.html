<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Two reports I noticed whilst surfing </h2><p>Firstly, we have a possible return of Bloo Taboo, that is, his name would seem to implicate it. He was... I dunno how to explain it, at any rate, the pics show some of his "activity", I'd say IP ban if it's the Legit Taboo. (Two words I never thought I would type next to each other in my life XD)
