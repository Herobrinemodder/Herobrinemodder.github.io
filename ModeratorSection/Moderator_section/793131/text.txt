Blaze has gone quite far, I doubt his claims, and I think he's been COMPLETELY irrational, therefor, I have posted a vote for us mods, The Council Of Hungarian Bancations!
If you think JN should perma-ban him:
Say, Perma-Ban
If you think he should be banned for a few days so he can think about what he said: Say
Temp-Ban
If you believe he shouldn't be banned and should simply receive a warning: say
No Ban
Remember, the quicker we deal with this, the less attention it will garner,
