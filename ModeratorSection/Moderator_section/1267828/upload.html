<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Glitch</h2><p>I really shouldn't be reporting this, but since I'm honest, I'll just do it anyways.
As you may know, I am Andrew and live with Alex (Party Doge).
I use his account for moderation duties but made this account to preserve his GC name (#Herobrine# was too ken by a stranger), and also to have my own private account.
Well, I have figured a way to access the moderator board and to actually respond to reports.
I still can't use any moderation abilities such as moving, deleting comments, etc.
Anybody experience this with alternate accounts?
