1409403047 Surikaten.: Hmm that is strange. Can I ask how you went about having the boards appear? It's most likely due to a more underlying bug with GC not refreshing properly when switching accounts in the app. We wont necessarily fix the bug until the new update comes out so you'll still be able to use the methods until then, but by the time the update comes out we could perhaps upgrade your own account to a mod directly instead so you're able to access the boards without any quirky methods :-)
