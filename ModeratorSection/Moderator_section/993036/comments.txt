1392634958 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., he has been really at this for a while now...more than a few months and he has gotten me in trouble in some servers more than a few times...of course I am biased, but, I am against him staying on the app.

@Frios10, remaining calm.
1392490791 Frios10: @Surikaten., ok
1392484894 Surikaten.: @Frios10, all calm no worries.
1392483836 Frios10: Just calm down everyone and let me handle this one. It will be a lot simpler.
1392483816 Surikaten.: @Frios10, took a look at his id and it seems to be the same RPX account who received a warning in the past, but tell him to cut the namefaking as it really benefits no one having someones reputation ruined for no reason :-)
1392483668 Frios10: Recently a user poped up and had the same name as rpx. People got them both confused and still do. They happen to hate each other. This is that user
1392483225 Frios10: He came on and copy's rpx 
1392483204 Frios10: That's munching somthin
1392483194 Frios10: That's not rpx
1392483183 Frios10: @Surikaten., wait wait wait let me try to do somthing about this. You guys let me handle this one rpx listens to me.
1392479686 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., Yes, RPX has always been a bit of a black sheep, pushing the app rules to their limit, at any rate, lately, he's started using racist slang and cursing, had to block him because of it, some of the comments should still be on my Q&A post
1392479475 Hotline_101: He was also impersonating mine, hmmmm, he's pushing the limits 
1392479255 Surikaten.: Warning fired, lets see if he stops now
1392477607 Surikaten.: We'll fire him one last warning and see if he changes it back, and if not then we'll go from there.
1392477389 Mcrbgaming: @Surikaten., I'm not sure he's been coping people for a long time though he's been doing it for a while, and while he's coping someone, he's cussing. It makes the victim look bad. Like hello said, Yeah he was warned a lot. 
1392476427 Surikaten.: Didn't this guy get two warnings in the past already for other stuff? Will look it up asap. Otherwise perhaps it's time to send him off on a bann as he has been doing things like these for a very long time?
1392450431 Mcrbgaming: @Hellomynameis99_, Yes I saw "RPX" commenting inappropriate language on a forum upload. No one really replied to the comment or said anything but you never know it may cause hate or something later on. 
1392450208 Hellomynameis99: As I stated in the group PM, this could cause issues if other users don't realize that RPX is impersonating a victim. If RPX shows the victim in a bad light by posting inappropriate comments and such, said victim may be accidentally taken as the perpetrator.
