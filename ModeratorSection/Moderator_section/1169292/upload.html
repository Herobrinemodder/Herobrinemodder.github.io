<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>New mod features</h2><p>Hey guys!
As you might’ve noticed, the new update is finally out and available for download on the App Store :-) In it we’ve included an array of brand new moderator tools, consisting of:
- Report ticket system:
Now possible for ALL users to quickly report comments / uploads spotted anywhere inside the app directly to the official Report-board. This board can Only be accessed by the moderators and once a report has been dealt with, it can be swiped to the left and the options to ’Mark as resolved’ or ’Delete’ emerge. Due to the inevitable fact that there will be reports on very mild things or false ones the option to also ’Delete’ a report exists to quickly clear any excessive reports off without having to mark them as ’resolved’.This will hopefully help limit the reports made to only real and concise rule violative uploads / comments and eliminate the need for multiple report threads. Do note however that it is of course perfectly fine to have your own Report Thread in tandem with the official ticket system if that is of preference! :-)
- Flagging system:It is now possible to ’Flag’ uploads / users and they will be saved in the flagged section accessible from the profile or directly from the in-app menu.
These features are still fresh and new so if they don’t work out 100% flawlessly don’t hesitate to fire us a comment here or an email and we’ll address it ASAP. And if you have ANY ideas on improvements / questions etc don’t hesitate to fire them here or in an email as well and we’ll look into it asap :-)
