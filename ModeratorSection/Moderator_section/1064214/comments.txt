1396923933 Frios10: @Surikaten., he's apologized but I'm going to keep an eye on him 
1396888857 Surikaten.: Looks like the rule violations are just a matter of time again for him, would keep an eye on him if he continues trying to anger more and more people without trying to contribute anything could look into sending him off on another ban.
1396838472 Hotline_101: Told him to block SF if he doesn't like SF on his posts, hopefully the issue is finished for now
1396817474 Hotline_101: @Belly326, wow, talk about lacking the guts to concede 
1396815539 Frios10: @Belly326, yea...if it doesn't go his way it can't go anyone's way.
1396811237 Xxxxxddddd: Yeah...if he's not winning my user battle he accuses the person of cheating and turns on anyone who disagrees with him
