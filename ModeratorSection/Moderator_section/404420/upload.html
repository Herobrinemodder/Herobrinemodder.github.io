<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>New moderator board</h2><p>Hey guys :-) As you probably already figured, this is a private moderator board where all things moderators can be discussed.

We also included another moderator exclusive feature in the latest update. You can now 'officially' warn users by tapping the moderator button on the upload pages and select 'Warn user'. This will make the comment you write appear with a red highlight, you can try it out here and see how it looks. Only use this when you are warning an uploader, as it could cause confusion if an uploader sees red comments in his uploads that aren't aimed towards him/her.

If you have any questions feel free to ask them here or email :-)</p><img src=New_moderator_board1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
