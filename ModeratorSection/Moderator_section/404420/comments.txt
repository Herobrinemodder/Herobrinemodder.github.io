1393734201 Hotline_101: Warning, stop using warnings to warn
1393721783 Hellomynameis99: @Mad Man T1zer 53, Strange... I think using the 'warn user' function causes that...
1393721718 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hellomynameis99_, um that's weird, your comment box isn't red
1393719856 Hellomynameis99: @Mad Man T1zer 53, You are being warned to stop warning with warnings!

1370473200 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., oh, ok. :)
1370473200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, thanks :)
1370473200 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, using the dev version right now. It will be fixed in the upcoming update which should be out early next week
1370473200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, and welcome!
1370473200 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, he does.
1370386800 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., its not giving one to me... Do you have the latest version?
1370386800 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, yeah in my version it is
1370386800 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., is this giving you a warning?
1370386800 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, testing
1370386800 Hellomynameis99: Disregard this
1370386800 Hellomynameis99: @Minecraft Seeds, I've found that you can warn a user (not the uploader) by tapping reply, then leaving the reply box and then reporting... Glitch or feature?
1370386800 falkirknh: @#Herobrine#, they ask us all. There is a help topic about it just read it briefly.
1370386800 toughguy42: @#Herobrine#, it's in the FAQs... Tell them to look there
1370386800 Bob Ross: @Minecraft Seeds, is it okay if I make a thread telling people how to become a mod? I'll just tell them to email you and help mods out. Nothing descriptive. People keep asking me, and it's starting to annoy.
1370300400 Bob Ross: Test testing...
1369004400 Surikaten.: @Hotline_101, ah ok gr8
1368918000 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., that

1368918000 Surikaten.: @Hotline_101, hmm dunno they usually reply within like 1-2 days, probably will reply asap
1368831600 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., but the AO hasn't answered a single email I sent in the last week:?
1368658800 Surikaten.: Testing another thing
1368486000 Surikaten.: @toughguy42, we currently can only do it over email - which is best because then we can exchange emails back and forth instead of a one way convo
1368313200 toughguy42: @Minecraft Seeds, I really like the warning feature, but how do we report users?
1367794800 Minecraft Seeds: @Belly326, no only warn the uploader of the seed with this feature for now. We'll improve this in the future so it works for users who commented as well
1367794800 Surikaten.: @falkirknh, i use the dev version of the app to check for potential bugs etc =)
1367794800 falkirknh: @Surikaten., where did you do all this testing before we had this section :)
1367708400 Xxxxxddddd:

1367535600 AndrewDill: @falkirknh, yea that was basically a test. Took me a minute to figure it out.
1367535600 falkirknh: @AndrewDill, well I think if you look at your comment you can answer that yourself :)
1367535600 AndrewDill: So this is how you use warnings?
