1386861920 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, Nope, you have been greatly deceived 
1386833810 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yeah too bad we only have one chicken on the server...
1386827410 Frios10: @Hotline_101, good chicken
1386815149 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, #ThankWizzz
1386815123 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, Yah, I like my chicken too
1386815112 Hotline_101: @Frios10, you haven't pmed him, he does a ton of reporting 
1386814999 Bob Ross: I saw this happening.

She first started cussing at me, then killing me on the server, and ignoring me.

I saw her fighting with other users, and right when I was about to tell Nahir, Hotline posted this.
1386814690 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, never heard of him.

I like your chicken.
1386814055 Frios10: @Hotline_101, hmm I would never picture him as one...then again I've only seen him a few times. He will probably be good if they want to appoint him. Can't wait to see. I need to get a report thread up...
1386813982 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yep, I believe that person is MCRBGAMING
1386810383 Frios10: @Hotline_101, he told me somthing about finding someone to fill her shoes in the next update
1386803581 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Kk, Surikaten said something to the same effect
1386802460 Hellomynameis99: Whizz PMed me about the upload disappearing. I sent an email to JN, and it's been restored. It was specified that the removal of Bolt's badge was temporary.
1386777853 Hotline_101: @Frios10, status, not statues
1386777845 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I guess, I'm not completely sure, Surikaten didn't specify her statues
1386776617 Frios10: @Hotline_101, she thinks she's coming back...
1386776003 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yah, I'm following her, so I can still keep an eye out
1386738840 Frios10: Dang. She changed her name
1386734168 kathryncrusher: @Hotline_101, I read them carefully... Its not mod-like yes...but I just cant... 
1386733166 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, Don't bother, read the pages, and decide what you think, I don't judge you for going either eay
1386733118 kathryncrusher: ...I dont know what to say... I cant say anything...
1386731660 Hotline_101: Well then guys, what do we do? This has never happened before in the history of this app? Does Bolt stay suspended? Or do we simply use discipline, and have her suspended for a month or two
1386729267 Bob Ross: Yeah Bolt was also cussing at me.
1386724460 Frios10: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, I just noticed
1386724402 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, im not even a mod anymore so leave me aloe
1386724355 Frios10: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, |
        \/
1386724312 Frios10: This is extremely un-moderator like. Fighting with a user because they told u wht they thought on it? U told them wht u thought in it correct? Next time bolt don't reply if they reply to you ok?
We r moderators and are here to set a good example. This is showing users that they can fight if they want and that's somthing we don't want. Once again in the future don't reply. Be the better person
1386717304 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hotline_101, No i didnt i swear. My mom took my phone from me before i even got the chance 
1386717234 Hotline_101: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, Yes, you did, why would any other mod have reason to remove them? No one else was on at the time except me, and I wasn't near the page 
1386715651 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hotline_101, sure i was arguing but y would i remove it? Thats just stupid of me to do if i removed it
1386715619 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hotline_101, I didnt remove it I swear
1386702776 Hotline_101: Guys, look closely at this post, and no, Bolt, removing the evidence isn't mod-like
