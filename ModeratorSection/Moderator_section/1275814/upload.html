<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Confirms</h2><p>Hello has run several tests on falkirknh's findings on an image and upload database glitch.
Now since the same problem has shown up again (as demonstrated by hello) we can confirm that falkirknh has definitely spotted something...
BTW Surikaten isn't a complete doofus so yeah some restrictions are still in force and this glitch I'm abusing can only go so far...so yeah I can't comment or again use moderator permissions, just answer reports and post.</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/09-06/Confirms1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
