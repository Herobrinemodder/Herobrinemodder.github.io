1409992613 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, so this bug is probably only on your device...sorry if I'm nooby Alex knows more about this than me.
1409992436 falkirknh: @Pykirknh, The image is an unedited screenshot which I took from my iPad. I tried to upload it and the optimizer turned it null.
1409992378 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, and where did the image originate from (why is it messing stuff up, did you upload it?)
1409992323 falkirknh: @Pykirknh, the image isn't the problem. The image exposes a bug on the server which accepts null images and lets them mess up the labelling system.
1409992267 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, and why only this specific image
1409992235 Bob Ross: @falkirknh, I think your iPad is too far gone with all your jail breaking and modifying.
1409992181 falkirknh: @Hellomynameis99_, Maybe it's how my device is storing the image. But their is a server bug which allows the corrupted image to screw stuff up.
1409992137 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, yes I thought that the problem was the image
1409992114 Hellomynameis99: @Pykirknh, That's the image Falk referenced in his post as the one that could be causing the issue.
1409992056 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, I saw the exact same image as falkirknh on pic 2
1409992018 Hellomynameis99: All the tests I've run have been negative. Either there's something I'm missing or the bug Falk found was specific to his device.

When you viewed my tests, did you see any issues? Perhaps the glitch affects certain devices, or perhaps the image was already correctly cached on my device.
1409991995 Bob Ross: I can comment back using this account though.
