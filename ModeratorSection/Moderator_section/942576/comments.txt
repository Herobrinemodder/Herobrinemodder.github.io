1390173282 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Pykirknh, you need to update
1390078015 Bob Ross: I can't see the text box only the keyboard guys I am typing randomly and I can't leave the thread...bug???
1389841446 Surikaten.: @falkirknh, same, but am only available when working. Always available on my phone though :-)
1389841384 falkirknh: @Surikaten., I'm not in a session right now, I personally idle on IRC 24/7 but that's just me :-)
1389837663 Surikaten.: Imo a pm session would be smoother as everyone idles more on their device than on the computer, especially for the app. A ping on the device would be more prone to a direct response from everyone anywhere we are :) We can use the session most recently setup or if someone's missing setup a new one with all of the mods.
1389834121 falkirknh: I was going to claim a channel but my IRC client died on me
1389829297 falkirknh: @Hellomynameis99_, Not really, cause people could accidentally leave and it wouldn't give us the full features that IRC does as it isn't a protocol that can be extended.
1389829083 Hotline_101: Aaaaaaaand, Falk, I agree, nice to see you back :)
1389829058 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, I already tried, unfortunately, not everyone was following everyone, so I could only add you and some of the newer mods
1389827869 Hellomynameis99: Good idea! Would a simple PM session with every moderator suffice? I think Surikaten. was going to set one up...
