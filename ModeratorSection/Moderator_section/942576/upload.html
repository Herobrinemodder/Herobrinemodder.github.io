<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Moderation IRC</h2><p>I think we should have an IRC channel for moderators to be on whilst actively moderating, that way we can ask questions amongst each other. JN could idle so we could quickly ping if there was an emergency, it just seems like a much better solution than posting threads about absolutely everything :-)
Any ideas on how we should host it? Esper?</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/01-15/Moderation_IRC1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
