<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Report Threads!</h2><p>Hey guys!
I know many of you take reports from report threads. It's easy and effective. However, if you don't use the app for longer than a day or two, they can get dangerously out of hand and can require a few hours to deal with the reports.
I suggest a single shared report thread, uploaded by Minecraft Seeds. Users can be redirected there via SeedsLinks from our old report threads, which we can slowly phase out.
After taking a report, you can remove the 'ticket' to prevent other moderators from having to check the report too.
Anyway, just a suggestion.
Debate! :-)</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/06-04/Report_Threads_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
