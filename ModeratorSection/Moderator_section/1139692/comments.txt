1402457043 toughguy42: Wow. I emailed JN this exact same thing a week ago!
1402237069 Hellomynameis99: Yep, I think we need an in-app ticketing system where only moderators can see tickets to let users report in confidence. Perhaps the reporter should be able to see the reports they've made too.

Until then, I think we should have a universal report thread uploaded on the MinecraftSeeds account.
1401895313 Hotline_101: Yep, It would work well that way, JN, step up to post one under the MCSeeds account?
1401893630 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, I agree, that's why a report ticketing system would be nice. People can report users in complete confidence. 
1401891019 TheCanadianFluffy: @Frios10, That would be good!
1401890998 TheCanadianFluffy: @Hellomynameis99_, I reply and remove the comment. Its easier to see whats done and Im sure people want to have here reports kept private :~)
1401889801 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Yup :-)
1401889303 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, somthing like that
1401889291 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, I think tree should be a section where you can report to and you have to report in a manner like

Users name:
What happened:

1401888784 Hellomynameis99: @TheCanadianFluffy, Thanks :-P

Do you like to reply to your reports or do you just remove them once you've dealt with them?
1401888263 TheCanadianFluffy: That is a great idea! I hope this does happen :~)
