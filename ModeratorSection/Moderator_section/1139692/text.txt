Hey guys!
I know many of you take reports from report threads. It's easy and effective. However, if you don't use the app for longer than a day or two, they can get dangerously out of hand and can require a few hours to deal with the reports.
I suggest a single shared report thread, uploaded by Minecraft Seeds. Users can be redirected there via SeedsLinks from our old report threads, which we can slowly phase out.
After taking a report, you can remove the 'ticket' to prevent other moderators from having to check the report too.
Anyway, just a suggestion.
Debate! :-)
