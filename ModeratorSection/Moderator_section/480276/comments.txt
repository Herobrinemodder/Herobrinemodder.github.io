Removing old names, reviewing others and adding new ones. :-)
1388248647 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Cleaning up? 
1388245680 Hellomynameis99: Anyone interested in helping me clean up this thread?

I believe it would be a useful hub of information when used properly :-)
1375570800 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, completely agree with that statement
1374274800 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, ok
1374274800 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, agreed... Just adding him now
1374188400 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, I think we should add RipjawBob to this list 
1374188400 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, Yes, sometimes I have to check myself when I feel like speaking the perfect truth to someone who Is majorly bugging me 
1374102000 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, heheh that's what I think OF MANY PEOPLE HERE AND IN LIFE.
1374102000 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Taco seems to be a rich little brat who thinks he can say and do whatever he wants 
1372719600 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, yeah, I've been watching him. It's always nice to avoid a ban 
1372719600 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, I did, but I would suggest to remove ihatecatsminecraft from the list...he has been helpful and not rude the last 4-5 weeks.
1372201200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, head over to Falkirknh's 3800 and 3900 private upload. There is a comment from your good friend there!
1372201200 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, aright
1372201200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, Added quite a few people to the list... Mostly your suggestions.
1372114800 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., well other than minor cussing and calling people either bïtches or retärds, no.
1372114800 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, oh is he breaking the app rules somewhere?
1372114800 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., yes...and people keep asking me to ban him and also the admin says he is not a problem.
1372114800 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, it's unnecessary though.. Just ignore small stuff like that because they have no good solution
1372114800 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., its grown into a problem then a hate obsession, and then a war. You know what? I am done with him. I really am.
1372114800 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, him lying shouldn't be any of your 'moderative' concerns though. His lies doesn't harm users or the app in any way, so unless you have a personal beef with him i dont understand why that's an issue, just ignore that stuff so it doesn't grow into a problem :-)
1371942000 Bob Ross: Oh, you can take off #~Herobrine~#, I banned him. He started cussing...
1371855600 Bob Ross: @Belly326, hey.
1371769200 Xxxxxddddd: @#Herobrine#, k
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, you can just check my new mod thread that has pics of it.
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, but wait
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, okay my "Report Abuse" thread. It's a little far down.
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, let me check...
1371769200 Xxxxxddddd: @#Herobrine#, where is mexicankiddnsaying that's he's a MCPE editor?
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, what.
1371769200 Xxxxxddddd: @#Herobrine#, woww
1371769200 Bob Ross: Due to minor cussing but major spam.
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, also, add ihatecatsminecraft
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, he's saying that when moderators deal with him we cuss at him and tell him we hate him. Can you believe it?????????? Some people actually believe it.
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, okay man I'm getting VERY worked up at him. He insists that he is a MCPE editor, but he doesn't even know how to use Perl, Python, JavaScript, Java, HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. He also LIED about moderators, guess what he said?
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, ...okay sorry I got carried away there :-)
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, if I had a kid, he would be WAAAAY less annoying than Mexicankidd, considering the fact that he'll cry a lot and I have to change diapers.
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, cussing, blocking users for no reason, insulting others in "Self Defense", and at the end of EVERY SINGLE DARN SEED HE HAS POSTED, IT SAYS "PLEASE FOLLOW IF NOT UR MEAN FFFUUUUU"

Seriously! I. Am. Fed. Up. 


1371769200 Xxxxxddddd: @#Herobrine#, what is he doing?
1371769200 Bob Ross: @Belly326, I am COMPLETELY FED UP WITH MEXICANKIDD...everyday a new report comes coming in and he always covers up his tracks! 
1371682800 Xxxxxddddd: Mail242 posted a thread called F*CK EVERYBODY but its removed. And he won't stop cussing as well 
1371596400 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, oh also add #~Herobrine~# for mod impersonation...BUT HERE IS THE CATCH, #-Herobrine~# is <:Lolz:>
1371596400 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, add Mexicankidd. On most of his seeds, they always end like this: "Follow me please and if not UR MEAN FU
1371596400 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., he was really getting out of hand. I'll remove him from the list
1371510000 Surikaten.: I can confirm that scubawaffle is banned :-)
1371423600 Hellomynameis99: @AndrewDill, I sent them an email :-)
1371423600 AndrewDill: @Hellomynameis99_,Oh I must have missed that.Where did they say that?
1371337200 Xxxxxddddd: Sky--Does--Mincraft says he's sky and his thread therefore he's impersonating 
1371337200 Hellomynameis99: @AndrewDill, quoting JNInteractive:
"About reporting users (with no uploads), you can email in to us for now if it's a major issue, ie excessive spamming or offensive language. If it's something minor you can just remove the comments."
1371337200 Hellomynameis99: @AndrewDill, I sent a bug report to the AO, so I asked that question at the same time.
1371337200 Hellomynameis99: @AndrewDill, :)
1371337200 Hellomynameis99: @AndrewDill, I wouldn't be the best person to ask
1371337200 AndrewDill: Hey how DO we report people that don't have any uploads?Do we send e-mails to the AO or what?
1371250800 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, No, he said it this morning 
1371250800 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, that's strange - perhaps they are reporting something they saw a few days ago?
1371250800 Xxxxxddddd: ShadowmasterOO7 (moderator) is impersonating mod
1371250800 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, According to a user, Scuba is still bullying and cussing this morning, are you sure he was banned?
1371250800 AndrewDill: <Amk57>
Cussed multiple times in comment (for no real reason).Needs to be banned but has no uploads so we can't report him directly.
1371164400 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, we'll keep an eye on him. I've added Scubawaffle, I think you've warned him a few times for various things...
1371078000 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, also #~Herobrine~# he is impersonating me and is refusing to change his name
1370991600 AndrewDill: pal norte

Swore multiple times in comments with asterisks substituted for a letter in a word (ex*mple).I would still consider that swearing since you can still easily read the words.
1370732400 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, it's good that a mod's status is blue and only visible in their page
1370732400 Bob Ross: @Hellomynameis99_, yeah I don't know why they even try that. They don't even spell it right, the M is capital like (Moderator), not (moderator)
1370732400 Xxxxxddddd: @Hellomynameis99_, good
1370732400 Hellomynameis99: @Belly326, Mortazan has removed his mod status
1370473200 Hellomynameis99: @#Herobrine#, thanks :)
1370386800 Bob Ross: TigerRZ has spammed multiple threads asking people to follow him.
1370386800 Bob Ross: 
RainbowSprinkles506

TheAmazingSpooderman

TigerZR or RZ
1370386800 Hotline_101: Id say look out for our friend Rainbow sprinkles, she called some guy a dumb A•• (Forgive my language) I posted the comment as spam
1370386800 Hotline_101: @Belly326, Wasn't that ages ago?
1370386800 falkirknh: 
Minecraft Seeds. copied the admins username
1370386800 Xxxxxddddd: 
Mortazan-327 put a (moderator) after his name therefore that's faking being mod
