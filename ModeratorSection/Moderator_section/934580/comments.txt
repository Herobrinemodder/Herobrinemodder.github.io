1389456239 Frios10: @Surikaten., he makes mods for minecraft and stuff. I have one of his mods there amazing
1389445476 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., Some of these things were running through my head as I wrote this... Of course, Apple would not leave gaping security holes. Thanks for clearing this up!
 :-)
1389442001 Surikaten.: ...and not necessarily a Seeds issue, more of an iOS issue if even an issue at all). So anyone can change the imagery of their local client and their version of the app. But it wont change anything for anyone else or give someone special abilities :)
1389441914 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, nah these things are all fine and I wouldn't assume he's close to becoming a moderator. You're correct that it is the server that unlocks them, so it wouldn't be possible to become one simply by modifying the client. Also since all the imagery of the app is stored locally on the device, anyone can root in to the app folder and modify the images (this is possible with all apps...
1389429053 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, I told him to post whatever else he finds in private and we could move it here
1389428876 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Ok then... He was uploading them in a public board though, surely private would be a smarter option?

I don't know what JN would think of reverse-engineering their app, that's all :P
1389428766 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, he said he could post whatever he finds and we could move it here for viewing I'm PMing him right now
1389428734 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, I knew he would find a lot he found the thread photos website where they are held. 
1389428639 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Surely JNInteractive look for this stuff? :-)
1389428394 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, I asked him to look for exploits but looks like he posted them as well. 
1389406651 Hellomynameis99: The other thread, which I had moved here a few minutes ago, disappeared... So yah. :-)
1389406451 Hellomynameis99: ...highly unlikely that Herobrine will get his features this way.
1389406376 Hellomynameis99: I think we have a future dev here! :-)

But in all seriousness, does this need to be looked in to?
When asked (on another thread like this) if it was possible to give yourself moderator features, Herobrine that is was possible and that he was 'close'.

We moderators don't have a different client to regular users. Our features are just 'unlocked' by the server when we connect. Therefore it seems...
