1405876634 Surikaten.: @Frios10, yeah if she has the notifications turned on :-)
1405830759 Frios10: Considering this is bolts upload does she still get notifications when we do something on it?
1404296903 Bob Ross: I CAN WARN ALL I WANT SHE USED TO BE A MODERATOR REMEMBER
1385168751 Frios10: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, what?
1385160866 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: Well that was a fail for me. I never get caught with my phone in school until today... 
1385136246 Surikaten.: @Frios10, yeah. We'll keep it in mind though in case we find some new method that could help prevent such cases too.
1385010995 Frios10: @Surikaten., it would cause problems with the filter if we added that though I think we have a comment deleting feature for a reason we can simply remove those comments
1384997852 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, hmm, true.
1384959868 kathryncrusher: @#Herobrine#, Indeed.
1384914552 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., ahem I know that sucks isn't heavy profanity...but you can make some creative sentences with the word.
1384914511 Bob Ross: You suck balls
1384886502 Surikaten.: Filter should be fixed now, the bug seems to have been that the filter wouldn't operate properly if you commented as a reply to someone. Should be fixe now though :)d
