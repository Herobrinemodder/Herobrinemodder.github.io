1410020266 Surikaten.: the bug in the app itself is fixed. And once it is hopefully it wont be possible to send that reason at all. Will look in to it asap so it's solved for the next coming update :-)

Edit: the server does perform a check though and checks if the reason is one of the ones available in the reasons list, however it does not validate against empty space and Select a reason so just in case there is a bug it can be properly detected and patched without the reports themselves getting blocked away.
1410020236 Surikaten.: Aye must be a bug going on with the app. It should not be able to submit 'Select a reason' as a valid reason, will look in to it and see what's messing about. We can add a check on the server as well but that would just be overkill since the choice select a reason shouldn't be possible in the first case, and if a user is able to send that as a reason and the server rejects it, they will lose the report they had written due to the bug. So rather let them be able to use the bug regardless until
