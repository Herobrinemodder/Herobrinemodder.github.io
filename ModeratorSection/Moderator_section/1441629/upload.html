My convo with him after responding to his report on the gay rights upload.
This worries me that he was hoping for a censoring mod.  I hope we're all forthright and won't censor because we don't agree with a users upload or opinion.
If that were the case with me, I'd delete all the religious uploads and keep the Atheist ones.  But I try to be fair.  I hope that's the same for all of you.</p><img src=tck13991.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=tck13992.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=tck13993.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=tck13994.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=tck13995.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
