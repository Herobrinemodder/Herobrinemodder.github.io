1380161079 kathryncrusher: I agree, I don't like it. people do that after cussing and there isn't much to do about it. 
Oh my, <Bubba fett> again. He is such a pain. Actually, he edited his comment after calling me something before I was a moderator. I'm pretty sure he does it alot.
1380151876 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @#Herobrine#, after its posted obviously fine 15-30 sec but like 5 min is to long
1380145724 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., Ah.... I think it's a little problematic for moderating, as they can pretty much escape with it, despite seeing it on notifications, we won't actually have any evidence :(
1380145019 Bob Ross: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, 10 seconds...that's as much time as it takes to press okay on the 'Comment Posted' push notification.
1380131957 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Surikaten., yes but what if that comment has cussing and they know the can get away with it cant the timer be like 5-10 seconds
1380131746 Surikaten.: @Hotline_101, it's still relevant though, they might as well not post the comment at all if they remove it immediately - barely anyone will see it within 30 minutes. Most forums use this system, so you have some tiem to change your mind for a comment - but when the threshhold is over it's uneditable
1380117018 Hotline_101: @Surikaten., That does no good... It means they just remove the comments immediately
 
1380114600 Frios10: @Surikaten., oh I didn't know that I will update it now :)
1380099553 Surikaten.: @Frios10, it has already been added in the second most recent update :-) You can only delete/edit comments that are less than 30min old now.
1380073938 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, sure
1380073860 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, hey can u comment on my progress thread
1380073846 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, o joy! 
1380073792 Frios10: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, it's another big update
1380073767 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Frios10, needs to come faster
