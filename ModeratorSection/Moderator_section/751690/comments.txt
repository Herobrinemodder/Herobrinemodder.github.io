1379026800 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Indeed, just because a few hundred users are being douches, we have to remember the 20,000 something other users :)
1379026800 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, exactly. There is a wider community that we need to keep in mind
1379026800 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Yah, I don't think so, JN has the right to ban people who disobey the rules stated
1379026800 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, can you get sued for being banned from a minecraft server? Same difference really :-)
1379026800 Hotline_101: I don't see why not, I say, If she wants it, let her have it, and keep that pic for reference incase she's trying to sue JN or something O_o
1379026800 Surikaten.: Uh that's weird. Will try have a warning fired and lets see if she cools down.
1379026800 Frios10: Wow that's strange a user asking for a ban...werid
