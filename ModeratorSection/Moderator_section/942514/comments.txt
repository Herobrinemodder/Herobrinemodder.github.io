1390539455 Bob Ross: @samellis, I've always wanted a quiet experience on this app...too late :-)
1390449720 Hotline_101: @samellis, ah ok, was wondering, you've only commented a few times that I can remember, good to know :-)
1390435197 samellis: @Hotline_101, silent, yup probably. Occasionally dip in here but never on forums. I do delete cussing and spam and occasionally warn users. V busy with work etc. 
1390413384 Hotline_101: @Frios10, not "at next", I mean "at me*
1390413352 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Frios, don't start getting annoyed at next it's not worth having the entire mod board in chaos...
1390273550 Frios10: @Hotline_101, oh u mean in general ok I thought u meant as a moderator...
1390251178 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I don't think she is either, I'm just stating she's quite active 
1390246713 Frios10: I just don't get how a person who isn't a moderator could help moderators more then me. I mean she still gets in fight a lot and if I've ever been put in iMessage with her she cusses 24/7 sayin she will never shut the **** up. I don't think she's fit for moderation hotline
1390246464 Frios10: @Hotline_101, if it helps u sleep at night :)
1390234571 Hotline_101: @Frios10, she's more active on here then you :P
1390037345 Bob Ross: @Frios10, yay! :D
1390036495 Frios10: I finally fixed my phone it messed up two days ago and I couldn't log on. I had to reset it but it works amazingly now! :D and I can get back on seeds :)
1390036298 Frios10: @toughguy42, :D
1389943839 toughguy42: @Frios10, I do! I love the smell of gunpowder! :D
1389936563 Frios10: Our me and fluffy the only ones hear that hunt and shoot? Or do anything country? 
1389936527 Frios10: @Pykirknh, yea it's sarcasm hotlines being a...I don't know how to put it nicely. And I'm Hispanic
1389936475 Frios10: @toughguy42, I'm with u
1389936466 Frios10: @Hotline_101, right because not being a moderator is definitely moderator active -_-
1389929043 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, I'm active! I just don't have anything to post! And FYI me or falk were the first. I'll check my emails! :D
1389928466 Hotline_101: @Frios10, she's active :P
1389927736 Bob Ross: @Frios10, hey are you Mexican?
1389927688 Bob Ross: Jeez I sound like a douche...no wonder I get rejected from chats!
1389927661 Bob Ross: @Frios10, is that a sarcastic comment? Or am I just too paranoid?
1389920628 Frios10: I like how bolt is considered an active moderator yet she isn't a moderator.
1389899511 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, WOOT!IM DA CREATION MAN!(by the way I also reported bugs for 6 months)
1389896669 TheCanadianFluffy: @Pykirknh, You were online 4 minutes ago. Just missed you :p
1389896439 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yes most silent he first wave is mostly dead, the second is partly, and the third is fluctuating.

1389887357 Hotline_101: @Frios10, XD
1389887206 Frios10: This is my all time low for PMing lol
1389887104 Frios10: I don't PM 
1389887097 Frios10: @Hotline_101, I PM everyday?! What do u mean I don't PM at all? Are u me hotline can u see my PMs? No u can't I was extremly active before this update I'm still geting used to it. I took five reports a day though PM from users like The_miner_legend and others. U take PM reports to hotline I can't see ur PMs so what do I say that ur semi active? And just because I don't PM u everyday doesn't mean 
1389886928 Frios10: Does it show that I'm online? Or does it say offline?
1389886925 Hotline_101: @Frios10, 1: you don't PM at all, until about yesterday, at any rate? What am I supposed to label you as? Active? You haven't been super active lately 
1389886715 Frios10: ...
1389883798 Frios10: @Hotline_101, right because taking reports every single day is semi active. Notice the sarcasm
1389859419 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Where did that come from though? What about me makes you think I code?
1389855813 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, but I don't make creations...I just rant randomly...trying towards being like Samellis and Hellomyname now :-)
1389852180 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I say things as they are Frios 
1389852120 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Originally, this was meant to be posted on the forums so people know where to report to
1389851788 Xxxxxddddd: Sorry about inactive ness is mostly school
1389849810 Frios10: I take lots of PM reports daily
1389849744 Frios10: Semi active just because I don't post on the mod board :P don't mean to complain but if ur gonna make one of these try not to place titles on people. 
1389849384 TheCanadianFluffy: Piraten is a stealthy ninja? Dang he is so stealthy I didnt know that :p
1389839460 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Snap... I knew I forgot someone......
1389834585 Frios10: @Hotline_101, u forgot me...
1389828950 Hotline_101: @falkirknh, Ah ok, I assumed you were still around
1389828934 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, No, I'm pretty sure you did some miscellaneous coding before
1389828099 Hellomynameis99: Where did you get 'coder' from? I don't think I've ever shared any of my codey stuffs on the app... Did you mix me up with Falkirknh?!? :-)
1389823397 falkirknh: I should be back for a while, I never really left, I just deal with mass moving of uploads and such. 
1389820099 Minecraft Seeds: @Hotline_101, aand fixed :)
1389815625 Hotline_101: Surikaten, just discovered a bug, moderator board uploads now pend....
