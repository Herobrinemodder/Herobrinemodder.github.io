<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>User Battle!</h2><p>Just like the recent Roleplay Revolution, one user posts a User Battle, then another sees this as a good idea and posts one of their own. Soon users see user battles everywhere and decide to post their own.
The result? The general forum is flooded with them.
I want your opinion - does anything need to be done about them? Encouraging users to upload in the off topic section simply doesn't work. A board (subforum) under the off topic section might work, but I think we want to keep the boards to a minimum.
Input? does anyone find that all the Minecraft related content is getting pushed down? Or is this just OCD on my part? :-)</p><img src=User_Battle_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'><img src=User_Battle_2.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
