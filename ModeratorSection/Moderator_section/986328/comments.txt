Hehe, I get what you're saying though. :-)
1392048619 Surikaten.: ... section still has more traction than ever before. It's just that the forum has the bumping system which makes it seem like there is more action there than seeds. People still upload seeds much more often than before and the selection grows ever greater :-)
1392048538 Surikaten.: Hm, perhaps a 'Seeds Pro' subsection to the Forum could help filter out those uploads a bit, as they are associated to Seeds Pro which is Minecraft related. We'll look into adding such a section and split the General section between a 'Seeds Pro' and 'Minecraft'. Although I would disagree that the app has lost importance to Seeds. People still primarily download the app for Seeds and the seed...
1392030066 Hellomynameis99: @Pykirknh, I agree with you. The follower system still has its perks though, like PMs and receiving notifications for uploads. It was originally intended as a way to show appreciation, recognition and acknowledgement for a user's (Minecraft related) content.
1392026508 Bob Ross: This app is becoming more of a social network, and followers are more important than seeds.
