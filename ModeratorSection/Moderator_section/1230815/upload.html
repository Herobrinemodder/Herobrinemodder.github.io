Hey guys! After collecting the information from my previous thread on the board, I present to you, the list!
Yeah, it sounded better in my head.
This is a draft for a series of uploads I'll post later in the week. Your input is appreciated! :-)
Surikaten., if you wish to upload this through the main account, just fire me a PM and I'll send the text to you in an email.

Please read this carefully if you are unsure where to upload or if you have ever been notified about uploading in the wrong section.
What can I upload in...
General Forums? (Link to "Forums - What can I upload here?")
Off-Topic? (Link to "Off-Topic - What can I upload here?")
Private? (Link to "Private - What can I upload here?")
What can't I upload? (Link to "What Can't I Upload?")
Thanks for helping us keep the forum clean.
