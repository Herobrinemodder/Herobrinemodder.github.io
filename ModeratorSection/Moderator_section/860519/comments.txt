1385753397 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_
@#Herobrine#

Well mocking jay does have ALOT of stuff in it if u have read the book and it would be best for them to split it in to so the movie didn't leave out a million parts
1385753227 Frios10: @Hotline_101, XD
1385746499 Hotline_101: It's good to be a guy... Less mood swinging XD
1385714715 Hellomynameis99: I agree with #Herobrine#... Why must they cut the final movie of every series into two parts?

Two reasons:
1. To make more money
2. For teh Lolz.

Edit: yes, I meant to day teh. :-)
1385696953 Bob Ross: I'm going to preorder tickets to part 1 and 2
1385696939 Bob Ross: They're going to cut Mockingjay in half because of the budget.
1385683702 kathryncrusher: @Frios10, Yes. Hunger games is the bomb right now. It makes sense though ;~)
1385668176 Frios10: @TheCanadianFluffy, yea I can't wait till they make the movie for mocking jay :0 it will be epic I want to see how they will put all that into a movie. I think catching fire was better then the first movie it was more like the book the the first one it was a bit different.
1385622833 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @TheCanadianFluffy, yea overall its not really that good. I just hope they make the movie better
1385617352 kathryncrusher: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, Im watching it right now. Have you read mocking jay yet?
1385617305 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @TheCanadianFluffy, Everyone has seen it at least 2 times I'm going for a second time while my friend is going for her first
1385617231 kathryncrusher: Anyways, We will miss you. See ya soon, hopefully!
1385617197 kathryncrusher: I've seen catching fire twice already. Cant wait for mocking jay. Read all the books so i know what will happen but still cant wait :~)
