1386520875 Frios10: @#Herobrine#, ha go to the "black market" u can live there just don't steal anything
1386460178 Bob Ross: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, because RPX's house sucks and taz won't let me in.
1386460153 Bob Ross: @฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf, not yet. Also, can I live in your house?
1386460028 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @#Herobrine#, Steve how original the eyes are wrong anyway if u want people to know u left
1386454498 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, JN's lack of response
1386445514 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, what's getting me, Micah?
1386431469 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, no, I think it's getting yours, Alexander 
1386377976 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., alright just making sure you know about the love thread havoc
1386377931 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @#Herobrine#, he sees them 
1386377884 Surikaten.: Report using the mod button instead :-)
1386377874 Surikaten.: Threads werent meant to be moved to the mod board, but if they are they can still be accessed via a users favorites or general profile, so thats how people still find the moved threads. This isn't a problem though as they can only access the upload that was moved and no other mod upload, but the upload itself shouldn't have been moved in the first place. Much better to report it in a new thread or
1386377694 Bob Ross: Waiting...

Also I'm leaving, heads up.

I'll post on that later.

For now, let's get Nahir to look at this havoc?
1386377512 Bob Ross: Alright I will delete all of them as soon as Surikaten. sees this
1386377487 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, heheheh...getting to your head, eh Micah?
1386346334 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hotline_101, Its herobrine i moved 1 thats it
1386344208 Hotline_101: Woah Woah WOAH, stop moving all the posts to the mod board, one is enough, we get the point... 5, a little much
1386343110 Frios10: @#Herobrine#, just saying we haven't heard anything from JN to start deleting theses so by moving them I would assume that it's a slight abuse of power I don't think we should do it till we get word from JN
1386342968 Frios10: Yea we shouldn't be moving them in the first place. We can take screen shots and post that instead 
1386315932 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @Hellomynameis99_, I didnt move the one in the pic Herobrine did. i did move 1 but the one i moved kinda deserved to be moved
1386315884 Hellomynameis99: Don't move threads into the mod section in the first place. If it's infringing on any rule, just delete it :-)

I'm sure it's just a one-off thing. If it recurs, I'm sure the Devs can work a fix. :-)
1386310476 Bob Ross: Maybe lag caught up...
