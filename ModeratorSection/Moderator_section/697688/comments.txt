1377212400 Hotline_101: @falkirknh, I believe you should stay if you want, or leave, Im tired of all the idiots on this app, it gets verrrrrey tiring :(
1377039600 Frios10: @falkirknh, um I don't think you've done anything wrong why put yourself under community review? It just gives the trollers a chance to get rid of a moderator.
1377039600 falkirknh: @Hellomynameis99_, It was a good suggestion but I don't think I would want one personally but for users like Piraten. And -Gino- that don't handle reports it would be useful.
1377039600 Hellomynameis99: @falkirknh, true dat.

Have you thought about a "Retired Staff" badge? I believe you saw my suggestion. 
1377039600 falkirknh: @Hellomynameis99_, I only have one no so far...I'm not worried because trolls can only vote only and likely won't go to they trouble
1377039600 Hellomynameis99: I'm worried though, what if people troll and vote no?
1377039600 falkirknh: @Hellomynameis99_, Thanks :)
1377039600 Hellomynameis99: :P

1376866800 falkirknh: @#Herobrine#, good :p
1376866800 Bob Ross: Okay. I don't hate you though :-)
