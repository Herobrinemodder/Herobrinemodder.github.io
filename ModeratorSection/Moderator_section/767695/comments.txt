1380415421 falkirknh: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, depends on the scenario, I like to not take any action because they could have bots stolen off a third user I am not noticing or something Along those lines
1380188522 Hellomynameis99: @Bolt~the~Legend~Lightning~wolf, Stealing a creation? Check both people's upload, see who uploaded first and then delete the upload that was uploaded after...

1380167610 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: @falkirknh, hey falk i have a question 
1380165133 falkirknh: We could do random upload checks so we only had a controlled amount of uploads to approve a day.
1379991954 Frios10: @samellis, btw I'm batman 
1379991944 Frios10: @samellis, I think it would be a very helpful feature for mods the pending thing is annoying
1379990453 samellis: I think they once said to me they get thousands of uploads a day -- so volume would be huge. There is always the risk of alienating mods who would come to resent the work needed. 
 
That said, it would be brilliant on a personal level! ;)
 
I'm sure some of it is automated -- swearing and spam filters etc, detecting if picture Is minecraft or a person
1379881477 ฿จடτ~τhཇ~ᏝεᏩεлd~ᏝᎥghᎿлᎥภg~ཡᎧโf: yes i moved at least 2 threads from forum to private becuz they showed themselves 
1379870826 kathryncrusher: @Frios10, Lol
1379865841 Frios10: @Hotline_101, I'm batman I can make it work
1379861304 Hotline_101: I think the chief issue is plain size as compared to the current "resources", 10 active mods, whilst compared to hundreds of uploads at one period of time, Im not sure how it'd work
1379860257 Frios10: That would be cool :-)
