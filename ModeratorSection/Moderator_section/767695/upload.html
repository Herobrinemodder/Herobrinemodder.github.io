Hey guys!
I've been thinking about how long it takes to approve uploads. Perhaps moderators could individually approve uploads? 
Think about it:
Pros: 
• Uploads could be approved MUCH faster
• Inappropriate uploads that might otherwise slip through the current system could be deleted before they are publicly available
Cons:
•If there are no active moderators, uploads will sit waiting. This could be worked around: If an upload has not been approved 12 hours after being uploaded, the old system will decide wether to approve it or not.
Things we need to think about:
• How many uploads are approved daily?
• Are you able to approve your quota of uploads daily? (If a few moderators are inactive at the time, other moderators must approve the uploads)
• Do we need to appoint new moderators for this system to be viable?
Thanks for your input!
Rate 1-5 depending on what you think of this. Leave suggestions, too!
