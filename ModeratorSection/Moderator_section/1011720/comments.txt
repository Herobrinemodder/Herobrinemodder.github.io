1393947347 TheCanadianFluffy: I agree with Hellomynameis. If it gets out of control we should put a stop to RPX.
1393674727 Bob Ross: Well if none of the students cuss or get into some serious issues, I'm guessing it's fine.
1393636350 Frios10: @MCRBGAMING, well it's rpx just trying to be funny he's not accutally teaching people to troll. And since moderators "troll" I don't think a ban or even warning is nessecary.
1393630119 Hellomynameis99: I don't think we should allow him to tell others how to steal names.... If he uploads a thread showing how to do it, I say remove for reasons I stated in an earlier thread.
1393619758 Hotline_101: Many people already troll, though we should probably crack down on anyone who is cussing a ton whilst trolling 
1393602685 Mcrbgaming: Comments in the upload already have cussing (Not from him though).
