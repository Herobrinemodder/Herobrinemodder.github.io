Hey moderators!
Remember RPX? And the whole trolling thing that almost got him banned? Well now he has classes teaching others how to troll. If you read his description it states that he's going to teach them how to steel names etc. I'm not sure how much of a problem this is going to make but with 20 people trolling it's not going to turn out "Good". 
Ideas? And I suggest not banning him or anyone because then the app will hate us!
