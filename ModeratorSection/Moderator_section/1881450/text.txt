Personally, I often find that users forget what they reported, and when I respond to their report, they have no idea what I'm talking about. This is especially true when a single user reports more than one item.
I think a simple feature like this would help out immensely and negate any need to remind the user of what they reported.
I thought I'd ask here to see if a feature like this would be helpful for you.
