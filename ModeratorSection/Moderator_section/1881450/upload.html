<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Report Response Feature Proposal</h2><p>Personally, I often find that users forget what they reported, and when I respond to their report, they have no idea what I'm talking about. This is especially true when a single user reports more than one item.
I think a simple feature like this would help out immensely and negate any need to remind the user of what they reported.
I thought I'd ask here to see if a feature like this would be helpful for you.</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2016/02-08/Report_Response_Feature_Proposal1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
