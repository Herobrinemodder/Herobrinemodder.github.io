So...I have learned from a moderator that a lot of the moderation team don't want to associate with me because of my erratic and immature behaviour.
Yeah, I get why and what you mean.
So I want to tell you that I have decided to...tune down in many aspects. If I'm going to be a moderator, I can't have my associates avoiding me and talking behind my back.
Yes, I will still be a bit weird (such as my fetish for steves,) but I won't be profane and acting as a 10 year old anymore, I guarantee you.
I will not try, I WILL be a new Pyk.
And also whoever kicked me from the moderator group PM allow me in again please. Thanks.
