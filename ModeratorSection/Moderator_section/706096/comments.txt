1377903600 Frios10: @toughguy42, awesome 
1377903600 toughguy42: @Frios10, ditto 
:)
1377903600 Frios10: @#Herobrine#, well I wouldn't do that to you. I actually have respect unlike some people who play football I am the one standing up for the kids getting beat up. 
1377903600 Bob Ross: Luckily, I roundhouse kicked one in THE NOSE and got away...we all got in trouble but they let me go Scott free since I was acting in self defense...
1377903600 Bob Ross: @Frios10, people who play football tried to beat me up once...the jocks hate me :-(
1377903600 Frios10: @toughguy42, man that stinks hope you get better in time. I just got back from practice we where lay'in people out all over the place. Man I'm pumped for football.
1377817200 toughguy42: @Frios10, LOVELY! I sprained my ankle! Looks like I'm going to miss my first game on Saturday... :(
1377817200 toughguy42: @Frios10, :) well, I'm about to go to football practice now, so see you later!
1377817200 Frios10: @toughguy42, oh if you where wondering intermediate is 5-6 grade my district is different. I am not in intermediate I play for my school ( which I have done for a few years now ) and I guess you could say I am one of those football jocks XD 
1377817200 Frios10: @toughguy42, I've heard of them. 
1377817200 toughguy42: @Frios10, oh. Well I do Pop Warner. They are country wide!
1377817200 Frios10: @toughguy42, actually I play for my school. I did play in a league a few years ago when I was in intermediate school but not any more. 
1377817200 toughguy42: @Frios10, I play football too! What league are you in?
1377817200 Frios10: @toughguy42, yea I love football
1377817200 toughguy42: @Frios10, You Play football?
1377817200 Frios10: @toughguy42, I wonder who will be appointed next?
1377817200 Frios10: @Hotline_101, well once football season is over I was thinking I could go back to moderating more. 
1377817200 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, Yep
1377817200 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, I was part of the original 6 mods... I guess I could take on the roll!
1377817200 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yeah...me XD
1377817200 Hotline_101: @Belly326, Im not so sure now.... School has started... And I have gotten a compelling feeling I should stay, someone needs to be the senior mod with expirience :)
1377817200 Xxxxxddddd: @Hotline_101, I might leave the app as well D:
1377730800 Hotline_101: @AndrewDill, You don't even follow moderators :(
1377730800 Frios10: @AndrewDill, oh. ( you can turn of the notification to see people's uploads that's what I did its in the app settings)
1377644400 AndrewDill: @Frios10,Im probably going to start taking reports this weekend.I also don't really like all the follower drama so I choose to only follow someone when I want to be notified of their uploads.
1377644400 Frios10: @AndrewDill, I have one more question. Why don't you follow anyone? Oh and another when are you going to start taking reports?
1377644400 Hotline_101: @#Herobrine#, lol
1377558000 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, okay bye bye 

Have fun...with life...and stuff.
1377558000 Hotline_101: Im essentially leaving this app because it's morphed into something Im tired of dealing with 
1377558000 Hotline_101: @falkirknh, lol.... Yah....
1377558000 Frios10: @#Herobrine#, I am not firing my helpers as well
1377558000 Frios10: @AndrewDill, yea maybe 
1377558000 falkirknh: @#Herobrine#, I am keeping mine so please keep me out of the thread or say I am not doing it 
1377558000 falkirknh: @Hotline_101, I have chosen my actual helpers correctly some people think they are my helpers but they are deluding themselves, don't tell them that :p
1377558000 AndrewDill: @Frios10,You know,mabey I should start taking reports.
1377558000 Frios10: @AndrewDill, thanks
1377558000 AndrewDill: @Frios10,True...you have a good point there.
1377558000 Frios10: @AndrewDill, I think some of them can be pretty helpful but you wouldn't know considering you don't take reports...no offense
1377471600 AndrewDill: @Hotline_101,I was like you and didn't get any helpers in the first place.
1377471600 Bob Ross: — —
WHY DONT WE ALL MAKE A THREAD WHY WE ARE FIRING HELPERS AND THEN JUST KEEP OUR OWN PICKS...THE USEFUL ONES
— —
1377471600 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, wait I've got an idea.
1377471600 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, exactly.
1377471600 Hotline_101: @falkirknh, As much as I hate to say this, you guys weren't very wise with who you chose, other then maybe Bolt and CanadianFluffy, most of them aren't remotely responsible
1377471600 Hotline_101: @Belly326, Good idea 
1377471600 falkirknh: I can't keep track of my helpers anymore :(
I just tell them to help and I trust them to do it. They are very self sufficient or so it seems. I encourage them to report issues to me and not try to solve it themselves.
1377385200 Frios10: @AndrewDill, two of my helpers really helper....the other one dosen't
1377385200 Xxxxxddddd: @AndrewDill, my "mod helpers" are not doing much and abuse there "powers" I might as well just fire them
1377298800 AndrewDill: @#Herobrine#,Well if they're really helping then keep them,but if they aren't doing much then I don't see much of a point in having them.But then again it is your call,there isn't a rule against having mod helpers,I just prefer not to.
1377298800 Bob Ross: Mine*
1377298800 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, mmhhhm...should I fire all my?
1377298800 AndrewDill: @#Herobrine#,I never really liked mod helpers either.People just wanted to be mod helps so they could say they were mod helpers.They didn't want to help,they just wanted a position of importance.
1377212400 Hotline_101: Oh sure.... Now everyone agrees with me After the fact... xD
1377212400 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, yup that's why I want to shut down ALL mod helpers.
1377212400 Frios10: @Hotline_101, what I really want to get rid of is all the sky doesmc/squid stuff and the threads made for spamming. All those thread do is cause fights and spam
1377212400 Frios10: @Hotline_101, well some of them are nice. 
1377212400 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Ive seen many of the mod helpers acting like wannabe bullies, part of the reason I disliked the idea, I don't think JN should look to them for mods
1377212400 Hotline_101: @AndrewDill, Thats why Im leaving, Im sick of this stupidity, this app has morphed from a app for posting seeds and cool creations 
1377212400 Hotline_101: Which mods? 
1377212400 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, no eta as of yet but it's only the final polishes left and it'll be ready for action. We'll do our best to try push it out asap, hopefully we can get it out within a week or two from now :-)
1377212400 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., and do you have an estimated time on when you are going to release the new update? I would really appreciate the update right now for I am pressured with school, exams, and on top of that tons of reports I barely get time to answer due to the excessive amount.
1377212400 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, awww but I've already made a thread about how COD Zombies Perk a colas taste like :-(
1377212400 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., WHOOO YOU GO NAHIR :-)
1377126000 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., you are awesome.

You know that, right???
1377126000 Surikaten.: Don't, in the next coming update there'll be added ways for moderators to be able move threads rather than just reporting them as well as brand new sections more appropriate for off topic and non Minecraft related stuff. Seeds uploads, Creations and Forum topics will be much more organized and convenient :-)
1377126000 Frios10: I feel the same but I am not sure JN will agree. I was going to email them about new mods but I guess you got it :-)
1377126000 AndrewDill: Yes the app is becoming a social network and I am not thrilled about it.I would love to start getting rid of non-Minecraft related threads but I'm not shure if I'm allowed to do that.
1377126000 Hellomynameis99: I completely agree. I've been falling behind in my reports :-/
