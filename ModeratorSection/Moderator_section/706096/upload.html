<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>I'm Concerned...</h2><p>I have noticed many, many good people (including mods) using profanity. If you think about it, this app is falling. It's been turned into more of a social network than a seeds app. No question, we need more moderators. The weight on our shoulders it becoming too much to bear. We need help. 

I'm going to email JN about my thoughts, lets hope we can pull through.</p><img src=I_m_Concerned_1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
