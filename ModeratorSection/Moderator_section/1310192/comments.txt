1413290155 Surikaten.: And follows lists will be revamped to include a follow/unfollow button directly in the list so it'll be much more convenient to unfollow/follow users dircetly when searching them up. Swipe to PM would be really interesting though - will write that up and see if we can squeeze in something like that in the upcoming update :-)
1413290098 Surikaten.: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩, comment histories are coming - swipe to PM could be an excellent idea! Will write that up, would make initiating PMs much more convenient.
1413207477 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, idea: 2 is pretty helpful :)
1413203267 Hellomynameis99: @✩✮✭TelepathicGrunt✭✮✩,You know what, I just suggested that to Surikaten. a few hours ago! Great minds think alike! :-P
1413201911 bubblybabs: @Hellomynameis99_, 
That last idea is a great one. The one you just stated in the comments.
1413198512 Hellomynameis99: @Pykirknh, That's what I'm thinking... I was also thinking that we (moderators) could use the swipe to initiate a PM with users, even if they're not following us.
1413193805 Bob Ross: Seems a tad bit unnecessary...more like an unnecessary shortcut because the uploads is just two taps away and the unfollow button is a tap away.
