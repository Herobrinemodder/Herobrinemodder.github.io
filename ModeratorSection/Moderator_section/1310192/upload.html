I have a small suggestion to integrate certain parts of the app more seamlessly.
The suggestion is, as you might have noticed, "Swipe to reveal actions".
This was just a little thought, and we'll have to debate on what actions/buttons should be on the swipe menu, if implemented. The blue "profile" button can be removed, as you can simply tap the user to see that.
What do you think? Awesome or unnecessary?
Suggestion 2 - Swipe to start aPM with the user, regardless of if they're following you or not. (Moderator feature)</p><img src=App_Suggestion1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
