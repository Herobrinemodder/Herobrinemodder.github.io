1381554352 Surikaten.: @#Herobrine#, 'sexy' is neither profanity nor offensive. In the wrong context it can at best be inappropriate - but don't bother reporting anyone for that word itself as it's nothing special. :-) Lots of people use it casually :-)
1381367103 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., hey 'sexy' got through the profanity filters...
1381366368 Bob Ross: And at that moment I knew 'she' was a pervert. Really, those love RPs are great perv nesting grounds.
1381366315 Bob Ross: Yes a user offered to have intercourse with me
1381272355 Surikaten.: We have tightened up the filters for these kind of RPs from now on so they will get flagged when uploaded. Hopefully we'll be able to decrease the amount this way :-)
