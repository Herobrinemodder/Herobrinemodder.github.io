<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Is this really allowed?</h2><p>I just don't see how this is allowed.  The reporting of someone's seeds even if they ink back to the original poster.  It gives them traffic for a seed they didn't find and it also means they had to upload in such a way that they had to fool the app availability checker.
