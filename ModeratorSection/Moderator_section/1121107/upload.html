<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>TheJackGaming & Gamingcocks 0.2</h2><p>Hey mods. These two were having quite a fight. Cussing calling each other names and all that. Jack started it and I hopefully finished it. Gaming kept it going to. They are both at fault. I say maybe a warning from Surikaten? What do you think?
Edit: It seems as if Gamecocks does not want to stop. He is arguing with me. He has not fought again yet because Jack has stayed away.
