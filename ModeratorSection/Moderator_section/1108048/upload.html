<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>ɱરᎯɱᎯՀίɴĢ11:D(GONE)</h2><p>ɱરᎯɱᎯՀίɴĢ11:D(GONE), now known as 'IM_STUPID_JBIDDNESS_LOOK' told me that he was leaving the app, and that he'd like me to ban him to prevent him from coming back.
Unfortunately, some idiot told him that he has to cause trouble to be banned, and now I've seen comments like this on a few threads.
Jbidness uploaded this thread about the issue.

Thoughts?
Image two is just something I thought I'd share. Looks like the comments have become sentient!
