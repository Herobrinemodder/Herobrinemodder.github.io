1399824363 Surikaten.: The second picture is due to a bug, but should be fixed now in the most recent update (6.0.1),, unless it happened using that version?

As for MrAmazing, we fired him a warning only about 3 days ago for excessive insulting but didn't seem to help. Will send him on a vacation for a while this time and hopefully it eases his mind a bit
