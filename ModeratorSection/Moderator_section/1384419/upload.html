<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>End of the line</h2><p>Hey guys I'm jut saying goodbye, i have grown weary and disinterested in Seeds Pro, I do still log on a few times a week, but not enough to continue moderating efficiently.
I really believe this is a goodbye for good, because I just have moved on from this app, not saying that it's bad, I'm just...worn out.
So thanks guys for taking the time to moderate, no one asks it of you but yet you still do it, thanks for being an amazing team and being excellent co workers and...bye!
Is it better if I get the moderator status taken away so no one will come to me for help and b greeted by a dead account, or is it alright to keep the moderator badge and status? It's up to you guys, whatever you prefer.
I might come on a few time in the next few months, but my visits will altogether stop, for sure.
Until next time, (or not),
Pyk</p><img src=End_of_the_line1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
