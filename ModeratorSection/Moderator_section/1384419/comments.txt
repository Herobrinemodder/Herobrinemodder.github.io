1421600097 Surikaten.: I completely missed this as well! Was awesome having you around Pyk and hope you return in the future, if not for uploading at least to remain PMable in the app! Mod badge can remain as Canadian said a bios update should be sufficient, but if you're still getting a lot of help requests we can remove it if you wish. Hope to see you return again in the future in any way possible!
1421583357 bubblybabs: Wow, really. I didn't see this and it's been here for almost 2 weeks.
:-(
Bye. I'll miss that language.
1421555452 DimplesCS: Im a tad bit late but good bye! You always were my favorite mod, and perhaps even one of the funniest users on the app! Its a shame to see you leaving, but we all will eventually leave:/ 
1420520909 Hellomynameis99: Yes, until next time! Thanks to you for being a great moderator, and more importantly, a friend to all of us. ;-)
1420510560 Hotline_101: I won't say I liked you all the time, but you were a good friend. 
1420510519 Hotline_101: See you :P
1420508793 TheCanadianFluffy: @TelepathicGrunt, Yeah we sorted it out. 
1420506743 TheCanadianFluffy: Bye pyk! It was good working with you, most of the time at least ;~)! I think you should keep your badge but just put in your bio inactive or something until hopefully JN comes out with retired mod or something along those lines!
