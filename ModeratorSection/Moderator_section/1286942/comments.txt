1410994230 TheCanadianFluffy: My friend hasnt said that he is trolling me yet but Im keeping an eye on this possible mexicankid.
1410975362 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, You would too, he (Or his impostors) are never up to any good on here, naming yourself Mexxicankidd probably means you WANT to annoy people and curse everyone out.
1410968977 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, wow you got something against Mexicankidd ;-;
1410963157 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, I don't know, I've only just heard of this user today. Fluffy would know more.
1410963113 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, True... Has he actually cussed/bullied yet?
1410963069 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Haha, not so fast! Could be a troll of Fluffeh's friend. We don't know that MajorKonfusi0n even knows that he/she's flagged as Mexicankidd. It could cause a... A major confusion.
1410962733 Hotline_101: Either way, ban him :P
