1407157937 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, I think we'll get a third opinion on that, however I'll concede that "Spam here" uploads can be placed on the off-topic section.

It could work both ways though - people might begin to think that spamming is ok and progress to do so on other uploads that are actually useful.
1407157308 Hellomynameis99: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, Follow for follows are useless if moved to private, as the user is asking their followers to follow them. It's better that they don't upload them at all.

As for spam uploads, I mean uploads that are useless. The uploading rules state that spam cannot be uploaded.

Uploads that users can spam on could be in private or off-topic, I suppose.
I don't understand why users would need to get their spam out though...
