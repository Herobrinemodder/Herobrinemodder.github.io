1390204092 falkirknh: After careful review of Creeper_Leader's threads I see a huge quantity but the average quality isn't very high, I'm not saying he has bad intention but his don't seem to be well thought out and his constant use if WHAT THE HECK could annoy users.
1390199459 TheCanadianFluffy: @Mad Man T1zer 53, Great :~) Well he is a nice guy try to talk to him if you please!
1390173167 Mad Man T1zer 53: @TheCanadianFluffy, don't really know creeper, but because of what everyone else has said... I'm in on the vote!
1390092070 Hellomynameis99: Creeper_Leader is another good candidate, yesh. :-)
1390077808 Bob Ross: @TheCanadianFluffy, yes I agree Creeper_Leader is a good candidate!
1390075815 Frios10: @TheCanadianFluffy, that would make another hunting mod i say the same! :D
1390070364 TheCanadianFluffy: Creeper_Leader is almost 13 . I suggest him instead of sfdude to be a moderator. :~) #VoteCreeper_Leader
1389892571 falkirknh: @Hellomynameis99_, That sucks, I think I'm following everybody bit I will double check
1389872006 Hellomynameis99: @falkirknh, Hotline made a PM with said applicants and a few moderators... Unfortunately many of us aren't following each other, so it was hard to get more than six people in said private message session :-P
1389865871 falkirknh: I think we should interview applicants to get a sense of their personality.
1389849781 TheCanadianFluffy: Ill go with sfdude. Very mature,very good choice :~)
1389729946 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hellomynameis99_, haha
1389729939 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, WOOHOO not older DAN meh!
1389679688 Hellomynameis99: sfdude is overloading me with reports now... :-)
1389667951 Hotline_101: @Mad Man T1zer 53, I think he's 11
1389664238 Hellomynameis99: Yep, I vote MCRB as the second new appointment.

That brings us to a SCORE UPDATE!
*7pm News Jingle*

sfdude: 5 votes
MCRB: 4 votes
1389656324 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, wait, is creeper younger than me?
1389656268 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, :)
1389655346 Hotline_101: @Mad Man T1zer 53, That's 5 SF votes then :)
1389653586 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, I found out that wsup99 wants to be a mod, but have had big issues with her in life... lots.P.s, I think sfdude would make a good mod:)
1389636135 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, As for Wolf And chimmno, no comment, I know absolutely nothing about them, so that's really up to us to research into them
1389636080 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Creeper_Leader, as "moral" as he is, is a little young, I'm not sure how well he would take the responsibility after a while
1389636020 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, MCRB is probably the best out of all the 2s for the job
1389606936 Hellomynameis99: So, we have a few users to look into...
I'm counting the original nomination as one vote.

sfdude with 4 'votes' (Seconded thrice)

MCRB with 2 'votes' (seconded once)

Creeper_Leader with 2 'votes' (seconded once)

Wolfdata with 2 'votes' (seconded once)

Chimmo with 2 'votes' (seconded once)

Heatseekerz with one 'vote' (Not yet seconded)

I suppose this is still open for debate! :-)
1389491438 Frios10: @Hotline_101, yea she is fit for a mod
1389469249 Bob Ross: @Frios10, I agree on sfdude, really mature user indeed.
1389457731 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Btw, when I said "earning followers", I mean she doesn't have an insane amount of followers, most of the "Best mods" in most people's opinions became mods when they only had a few hundred followers at most, it's harder to get corrupt when there's less temptation of followers
1389457652 Hotline_101: @Frios10, She's more "balanced" then Bolt, Bolt has ADHD, and hyperactivity too, that really ended up bad for her, we should really look into that with SF and MCRB, though I don't think we will find MCRB to have many issues
1389457586 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I agree too, unlike Teague or Bolt, she's earning followers, and she's kept silent when it comes to fights, here's what I think, if I had to take two votes

MCRBGAMING
and 
SFDude
1389456278 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, I think sfdude would be a great moderator
1389454976 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, True.... We are too divided....
1389403409 Hellomynameis99: And thoughts on sfdude? Constantly helpful, mature user...
1389402476 Frios10: @Pykirknh, ....
1389389952 Bob Ross: @Frios10, I still don't trust Wolfdata...
1389367769 Frios10: @Hotline_101, same here...
1389367416 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I get sick of people like that who can't seem to stand up for themselves....
1389334182 Frios10: @Hotline_101, I guess it's 2 against 2

1389334163 Frios10: @Hotline_101, he's been reported for stupid things like disagreeing with someone and they got mad and reported him...just another person who thinks they need to report every offensive thing like an opinion. 
1389333118 Hotline_101: @Frios10, I'm not sure I agree with Wolfdata either, I vaguely remember people reporting him to me for cussing a lot, and I may of even had to confront him
1389329425 Frios10: @Pykirknh, that doesn't sound like him. Plus it's two against one here Andrewdill agrees
1389327265 Bob Ross: @Frios10, Wolfdata is a douche and cuss-spammed in my first 5 months of being on seeds pro...he was like the old RPX.
1388903388 AndrewDill: I agree with Wolfdata, he use to report to me and handle things well.I also say MCBRGAMING.His last upload was on December 29th 2013 so I would say that he is still active.He also does some great seeds.
1388902754 Frios10: he's a great person and would make a great moderator
1388902694 Frios10: I have another one

Heatseekerz(Awsmo) 

That's his name.
1388884315 TheCanadianFluffy: @Mad Man T1zer 53, He hasnt been active for a while. But he is a good choice.
1388869709 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Hotline_101, maybe chimmo, hes active, a good helper and is mature.Im not sure who else, he's my only vote.
1388782540 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Hmmm, I've confused Wolfdata with someone else who had a wolf name, but I forget what that guy's name was
1388770698 Frios10: Ok bolts out of the picture she got in way to many fights and spammed up the mod board. Ring a bell anyone? I have a good person. Wolfdata that's not his full name but he would do good I could post his full name
1388765436 Hotline_101: @TheCanadianFluffy, She's always hyped up.... I guess she does have ADHD
1388761400 Hotline_101: @Pykirknh, Yah, he used to be active 
1388736165 Bob Ross: I have a feeling that no one takes me seriously anymore with this skin...
1388736112 Bob Ross: I say, BOLT IS FREAKING HAVING A MELTDOWN....SHE IS USING CAPS CAN YOU BELIEVE HER???? SHE IS NOT FIT FOR MODERATOR DUTY IF SHE IS USING CAPS.

Blaze king is really immature, MCRB is not very active from what I has seen....

And I vote Creeper_Leader for moderator soon.
1388735575 TheCanadianFluffy: Im not sure on who to appoint but not Teague :p For one if you see him on iMessage he swears 24/7, I dont trust that. For two he isnt mature enough and I could never put something important in his charge. Id say bolt would be better later on maybe, but not yet. She seems to hyped right now :P
1388725865 Hotline_101: How are there 2 ratings? :P
1388725564 Hotline_101: Far as I know
1388725558 Hotline_101: As for users I'd be against, firstly, Blaze, he's gotten banned twice, and he really is a douche when it comes down to it, User 2, Teague, we've all seen what happened with Bolt, she was super popular, and had a ton of followers, the more you have, the higher the fall as you might say, Teague is to popular, and I don't think he has a real idea on moderating, he's never reported anything to JN as 
1388725452 Hotline_101: I would suggest MCRBGAMING and maybe Creeper_Leader, both have actively reported stuff to JN (Creeper_Leader still does, and I'm not sure about MCRB these days)
