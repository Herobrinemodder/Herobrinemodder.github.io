<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Who would YOU suggest for Moderator?</h2><p>Hey Moderators,
I'm not staff at JN or anything, but I believe the season for new Blood on this board is coming with MCSeeds Pro 5.0, and, as it is our job to look out for rulebreakers and bullies, it's also our job to inform and look for people who can help us out with moderation and are good candidates.
The long short of what I'm saying, (I'll stop speaking in Politician Speech) is this, though moderators are completely up to JN to appoint, I think we should suggest people we think would fit the role well and help JN fill the blanks for who to appoint if they have any confusion on who to appoint.
Also, you could just also put who NOT to appoint... I already have someone in mind... No, not Bolt,
I'll comment...
