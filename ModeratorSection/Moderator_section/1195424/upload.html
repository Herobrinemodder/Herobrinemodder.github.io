<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Warning Glitch</h2><p>Hey Moderators & JN,
Today, I issued a warning (my first!) at a user for cursing excessively. At the time, my comment was a warning, but when I re-checked the thread, realized that my comment was no longer a warning. 
Hope you can fix this glitch, JN!
