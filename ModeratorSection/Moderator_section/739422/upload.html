<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Mod tools</h2><p>We REALLY need these two essential tools, I believe:

(1) An official reporting system with tickets. (as Hellomyname has suggested)

(2) A way to remove threads. There are lots of bad threads that I report and it takes at least 2 days for it to disappear.

Who agrees?
