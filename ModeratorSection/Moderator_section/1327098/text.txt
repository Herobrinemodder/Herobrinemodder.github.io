First 3 images are comments rivas04 left on a single users upload about his dog who died.  I'll add a link but I'm pretty sure I deleted that nastiness.
Forth image is where they dared ask a question to try and make me look stupid.  My question.  Um, was my reply too mean spirited?  Should I edit or delete it?  I hate when I respond to something as a mod and then have 2nd thoughts about it.

Ok, I don't feel bad about my comment because rivas04 went back to that dog memorial and made some more mean comments to other users.  Maybe one of you can take care of the other meanness they sprinkled about?

I wonder what other mean things they are saying elsewhere?
