1386378494 Surikaten.: Hopefully that should tiden things up a bit on the public boards
1386378479 Surikaten.: We do allow love rps but apparently people always cross the line at one point or another in these types of threads which have unfortunately forced us to tighten up the filters on these types of rps. Fewer will from here on end get approved and if people just reallyyy have to amke a Love rp they can upload it as a private where not everyone will be forced to see it.

1386302292 Hotline_101: @toughguy42, Agreed
1386294439 toughguy42: @Hotline_101, I hate Roleplays. They are stupid in my opinion
1386258928 Hotline_101: @Frios10, Yah, I've always disliked RPs
1386222096 Frios10: I thinks RPs r strange like why take a role of a fake person and waste time doing fake things and it doesn't benefit u. Acting benefits with money and entertains people but why do RPs when u can live YOUR life instead of pretend to be a fake person u know? Especially love RPs I think they need to go...but considering we have an RPs section we have to allow some RPs I guess
1386213836 Hotline_101: Erm... It's doubtful that everyone will listen...
