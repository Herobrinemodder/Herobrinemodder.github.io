1413907838 bubblybabs: Ok, I left a comment for Puff and I'm going to tell Server to not use profanity no matter how much he is goaded. And to not get into arguments like that again.
1413874535 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, yeah he probably faked the evidence and didn't bother to edit the comment datestamps
1413874500 bubblybabs: @Pykirknh, meant the Puffy times on his "proof" image he uploaded
1413874413 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, or if you mean the comments above, then either puffy photo shopped and faked evidence (that's why the comment times are mixed up) or, again, the time is screwed up.
1413874300 Bob Ross: @bubblybabs, either you have comments sorted by Top Rated instead of Newest (find setting at top of comment section), or Seeds Pro is lagging (has a tendency to do that and get funky with time)

Puffy uploaded this as "proof" Server was cussing. But why do the seconds on the right side go 3s, 0s, 4s?
