1412156418 bubblybabs: Does the flag option flag it for all mods or just for yourself?
1412139082 TheCanadianFluffy: What hotline said :~P
1412136990 Frios10: @Hotline_101, well you about covered it
1412133051 bubblybabs: Ok, thanks.
1412132686 Hotline_101: PS, report upload actually hides the upload, not technically removes it, but I think JN generally remove the posts reported.
1412132564 Hotline_101: Report upload sends the post to JNInteractive so they can remove it, only if the upload breaks rules.

Warning is for everyone, but can be specifically addressed to one person.

And yes, Report upload is essentially deleting the upload
