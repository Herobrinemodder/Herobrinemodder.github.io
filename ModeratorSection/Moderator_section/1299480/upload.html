<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Mod button functions</h2><p>When I click on the "report upload" option, where does it go?
If I use the "warn user" option, it's public, right?
Are mods able to delete uploads?  Or is that what the "report upload" is for, so the upload goes to someone who can delete it?
Thanks</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2014/10-01/Mod_button_functions1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
