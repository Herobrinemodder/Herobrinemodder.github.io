<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h2>Comments like this</h2><p>Hey all,
So I know that we have the block and ignore feature for comments like these, but what good do they do for the app? They are like a bad user who has nothing to offer other then excessive rule breaking. May we remove these comments?
What do the rest of you think?</p><img src=https://mcseeds.mobi/seeds/imgrdrct.php?p=mcsp17&url=seeds/user_uploads/Moderators/2015/11-27/Comments_like_this1.jpg alt='mcseeds'></body></html>
