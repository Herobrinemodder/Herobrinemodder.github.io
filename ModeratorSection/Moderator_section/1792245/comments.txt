1448927600 Frios10: So comments like this can be deleted?
1448602330 bubblybabs: @Frios10, 
Dunno. I figure who wants to see that stuff so I've been reprimanding and deleting for the past year.
1448602142 Frios10: @bubblybabs, ah. I was under the impression all we should do is tell the user to block/ ignore them.
1448601603 bubblybabs: I usually reprimand and state I'm deleting the comment. Then delete.
1448601467 Frios10: @TelepathicGrunt, well I wasn't talking about this user. I was comparing his comment to an excessive rule breaker. Both have nothing good to offer for this app. I was asking if we can simply remove comments like these.
