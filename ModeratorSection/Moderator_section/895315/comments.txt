1387681541 Surikaten.: We'll be adding a no comment system into the app in the update following the upcoming one, we will look at squeezing this mod feature in for it as well, sounds like it would be useful :-)
1387665427 Hellomynameis99: I support this idea.

Don't forget that the coming update (to be released some time this month) brings a new formula to hopefully bring more relevant minecraft related content to the top of the forum, which should hopefully help keep useless uploads hidden. :-)
