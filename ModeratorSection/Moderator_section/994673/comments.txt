1392725588 Mad Man T1zer 53: I haven't run in to him before, I like dealing with the lower rebels :P
But from what I've heard about him, I think he should be maybe temp banned.
1392569371 Mcrbgaming: @TheCanadianFluffy, Agreed fluffy! 
1392564895 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, well, for Frios he did it unintentionally 
1392564860 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, RPX and Frios
1392564827 Hotline_101: I don't trust him, we go back a long time, at least as long as you have Frios
1392538870 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, cool :P
1392538832 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, there are a few who don't, I suppose.

And it's raining here :-P
1392538723 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, how's Australia?
1392538714 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, everyone who isn't a moderator wants him to stay :)
1392538296 Hellomynameis99: Gah! The general forum is now clogged with #SaveRPX reposts! Who started this?!
1392534782 TheCanadianFluffy: Yeah I warned if a few times because he was talking about thiNgs little kids shouldnt see. I warned the other users causing problems too. I say next time he cusses,is racist or harasses someone he is banned. Its not that I don't like him, Im treating this like anyone other user violating app rules. Agreed anyone?
1392525039 Frios10: @Surikaten., ok :-)
1392523451 Surikaten.: Alright hopefully he means it :-)
