1405355588 Minecraft Seeds: Aaand banned. Sorry for the delay :-)
1405351078 Frios10: He's still unbanned...and still spamming threads with reasons to ban teague
1405183014 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, possibly 
1405182994 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, sympathy? Hmm, strange way to gain popularity... 
1405182951 Frios10: @Hellomynameis99_, yep. Just a troll. What did she ever hope to gain from that.
1405182918 Hellomynameis99: @Frios10, Ahh yes, we were all preoccupied with the shay drama :-)
1405182864 Frios10: Bump. This guy hasn't been banned yet I don't think.
1405100118 Xxxxxddddd: Yes a ban would be great because he made an account just to hate on Teague.
1405033086 Frios10: I agree that he should be banned. First of all he made an account just to hate on Teague. Useless. Second of all hate threads and spam hate comments are against the rules.
1405026935 TheCanadianFluffy: Hotline is right about Teague being a jerk on iMessage. And addition to that he also swears there. He keeps it off seeds pro though. This guy needs a ban. He is just a jealous hater... With true facts...
1405012208 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, the comment doesn't surprise me :P
1405012182 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, This could get real interesting...

1405012164 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, So Shadowpuppy's involved, you say?
1405011949 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, yep, Teague was a real douche on IMessage, that's part of the reason I dislike him, however, it shouldn't effect what he does here
1405011897 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Could just start with banning the account, and if they get it back up and running, blast an IP ban at each member involved with the account.
1405011836 Hellomynameis99: @AndrewDill, Exactly, and I don't think what people do on other apps or in life should affect the app - it's an entirely different environment.
1405011765 Hotline_101: Learned a little something else... This account is a group account, an IP ban wouldn't work without banning numerous IPS....
1405011665 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, You may want to re-read my comment, I edited ut
1405011618 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, Let's just say, I was PMing our Teague friend when she suddenly started PMing... She isn't following me, it would appear she is the user who made the account, the weird thing is that it happened in the exact same PM session, which I didn't add her to
1405011572 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, How do you? Whaat? How do you know?
1405011544 AndrewDill: Yea this guy needs a ban.He might not be entirely wrong in his statement,but he is definitely breaking rules by spamming.
1405011542 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, revelations, it's ShadowPuppy :O
1405011518 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, He's uploaded a thread with the same message, which I've removed to private while I await a reply...
1405011469 Hotline_101: I warned him to stop spamming on a post he spammed 
1405011447 Hotline_101: The dude is essentially threatening me over PM, he seems to know my address from 'Teague'... I'm doubtful..
