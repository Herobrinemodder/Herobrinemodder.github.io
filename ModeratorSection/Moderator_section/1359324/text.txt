Want to know the rules on seed ownership.

I've seen some people attacked for uploading a seed for the next version of MC that had already been uploaded by someone else in a previous version.  And then, at other times, a seed that's uploaded that way is left unmolested.
What, exactly, are the rules?  If someone finds a seed and uploads it the first time, that's their seed forever?
At times people upload seeds from the Internet.  That's not ok either, right?  Or it's ok as long as they say they found it, right?
