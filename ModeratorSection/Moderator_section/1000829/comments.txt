1393434470 Mad Man T1zer 53: @Surikaten., maybe there could be a use added for #'s.There could be a hashtag searching bar, which makes it easier to find uploads related to the word connected to the hashtag.
1393290492 Frios10: @Surikaten., ok :-)
1393263988 Surikaten.: @Frios10, problem with that though would be that it would limit everyone from using # regardless of reason. Censoring an entire character can be a bit problematic. We'll however not implement a feature that uses the hashtag so users eventually realize en masse that there's no use to actually use it :-)
1393256037 Hotline_101: @AndrewDill, yes, we don't need more hashtags
1393255636 Mcrbgaming: @Frios10, make #'s profanity! That would stop #'s on the app. 
1393253287 Frios10: @Surikaten., hmm we could just remove # entirely it doesn't so anything on here
1393234738 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., Fuzz ;-)
1393234180 Surikaten.: Hopefully that will help clear the forums a bit :-)
1393234038 Surikaten.: These #Save/Bann RPX threads can be removed as there's really absolutely nothing to 'save'. RPX wont get banned as long as he doesn't himself, deliberately and excessively violate the rules again and removing these threads should surely help decrease the amount of fuzz about it. The people still complaining can be directed to email and we'll explain to them how it works thoroughly.
1393232820 Bob Ross: @AndrewDill, totally.
1393224478 AndrewDill: Why are people using #s here anyway?It's not like they do anything!This app keeps getting more and more like Facebook(in a bad way).
1393223463 Frios10: Not like it's offensive or nothin 
1393223450 Frios10: Doing that's kinda a ban of speech huh?
1393216716 Mcrbgaming: @TheCanadianFluffy, there are more saveRPX them ban RPX so let's try not to ban him, like you stated below. 

And Yeah it's really annoying!
1393084953 TheCanadianFluffy: This is getting way out of hand. I just want it to stop. Banning RPX may make it worse but me need to do something. I agree with Hotline though. Make anything to do with Saving rpx profanity. Its so annoying.

#SaveRPX #Save RPX # Save RPX Save RPX! <--- All that stuff... POOF GONE
1393066553 Bob Ross: @Hotline_101, only #SaveRPX...
1393043761 Hotline_101: @MCRBGAMING, Hmmm, maybe #SaveRPX and #BanRPX should become profanity for the filter XD
1392875285 Mcrbgaming: Yes I can, and anyone else that didn't install the update, I installed it on my phone and now I must use my iPod. :-/

Anyways, this "RPX" thing is way to out of hand. It's taking up most of the forums with the #BanRPX and #SaveRPX. I think something has to be done but I'm not sure yet :-/
