As we all know the user andg2006 was banned a while ago. She has made another account and I have been watching it. She was fine until I noticed a hate thread towards her "target" <Bubba fett>. While I was dealing with it she was saying she would post another after I removed hers. Though the thread was not much it was enough to bother <Bubba fett>. The thread is in this board called "Now thats mean" if you would like to see it. I will keep my eye on her, but we may have to take serious matter.
