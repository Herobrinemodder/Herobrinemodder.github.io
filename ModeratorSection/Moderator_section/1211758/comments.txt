1406739483 Surikaten.: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, ahhh awesome, great find! Will look in to it ASAP, hopefully a fix can be dispatched remotely without the need of an update.

Edit: aand now should be fixed! :)
1406733269 Surikaten.: @Ꭲelepathic☆Ꮐrunt༹™, hmm very strange bug, it seems to occur at some times and sometimes not. Did you perhaps follow any particular pattern when you posted the comment? For example pressed the regular 'Comment' button then switched over to the 'Warning' option or something similar? Can't seem to find any potential holes that would allow for the comment to be reset from 'warning' to regular. Does it occur often or only on specific occasions? Let me know and I'll re-dig into it ASAP :-)
