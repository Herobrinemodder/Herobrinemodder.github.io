The upload where I messaged him about that upload I deleted:

I don't mind images of gay couples kissing.  I don't mind innocent images of children giving each other a little peck kiss.
This image, however, is one of child sexual abuse.  Those two girls are being encouraged by the adults around them to kiss that way.  I'm surprised the guy you see in the background doesn't have a bulge in his pants.
