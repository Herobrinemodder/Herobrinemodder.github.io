1391743534 Bob Ross: @Surikaten., your :-)'s are so addicting. :-)
1391725301 Surikaten.: @Hellomynameis99_, tried looking in there as well but seems like he/she changed username completely? Remember a comment or two he/she posted that i could grab his name from? :-)
1391641327 Hellomynameis99: @Surikaten., Sorry about that! You can grab the username from seeds://s4IDNycTO
1391628064 Surikaten.: What's his/her real username? Couldn't see it in the upload and emotiuser/emoticon user doesn't show anything. Will fire him a warning and hopefully he'll cool down a bit :-)
1391614752 Hotline_101: @Hellomynameis99_, I was dealing with Emoji :P
1391588166 Hellomynameis99: @Hotline_101, Ahh, sorry for the misunderstanding. I was wondering if anyone knew more concerning this case, but I'm willing to investigate further if not. I think we should send EmotiUser off with a temp ban for a short while at least.
1391567927 Bob Ross: ...
1391527168 Hotline_101: I have earned her particular hatred because I thought you were dealing with HorseJedi, and therefor didn't get to sending Horse a warning 
1391525982 Frios10: We should ban him
1391502300 Bob Ross: I took a screenshot of that to upload after school but I forgot XD
