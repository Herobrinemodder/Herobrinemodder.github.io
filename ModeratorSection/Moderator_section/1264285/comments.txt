1409336514 Minecraft Seeds: Hey guys, would just like to chime in here real quick regarding this issue in order to prevent any future potential headaches :-)

Currently, uploading other users creations is not necessarily against the rules, unless the original creator himself contacts a mod and requests the upload to be taken down. Since otherwise the burden of proof falls on to the moderators and quickly becomes an immense load of work to have to prove who and who has built what and whatnot :-)
