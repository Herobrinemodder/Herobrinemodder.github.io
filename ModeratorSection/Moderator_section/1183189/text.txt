Hey mods. I know most of you guys have been a mod longer than me. Most of you are all pretty active. Today I have decided that I am leaving Seeds Pro. I am not very interested in Minecraft anymore and my 
Iife is very busy. I dont have time to come on and take reports anymore. I will make the odd comment on a important thread and maybe show up in PM a few times but for now I will not be very active.
Thank you all for a great time on Seeds Pro. You are all great moderators and I will miss you all.
Thank you, TheCanadianFluffy
